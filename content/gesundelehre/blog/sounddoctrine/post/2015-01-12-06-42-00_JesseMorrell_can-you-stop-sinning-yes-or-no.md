<p><strong>Can You Stop Sinning?</strong><br />
<em>1. Corinthians 10:13</em></p>
<p>Is it possible to stop sinning? The answer is „yes, it’s possible to stop sinning“. The Bible says in 1. Corinthians 10:13, that God never let’s you to be tempted above your ability. That every time that you’re tempted, you’re able to bear it, because God provides a way of escape. And so God makes sure, that the temptations that we face never exceed our ability. So we always have the ability to not sin. In the moment of temptation, we have a free will choice between sinning and not sinning. We have a free will choice between obeying God and disobeying God. And we need to make that choice every day of our life. If it were entirely a matter of grace, we would never sin again, ’cause there’s no free will involved. If it was entirely a matter of grace, if we did sin, it would be Gods fault. Since it’s not Gods fault if we sin it must be a matter of free will. And so yes, it’s possible to stop sinning. You have no excuse for sin, you have no justification for sinning, you can avoid sinning. I could end the video right there and say “enough said, you can stop sinning – Do it today! do it now!”</p>
<p>But we life today in an age of compromise, there’s a lot of sin and wickedness in the church. And the theology you hear from the pulpit is that sin is unavoidable, sin is inevitable. They teach the perpetual sinfulness of Christians, that you’re going to sin until the day you die, that you can’t stop it, you can’t avoid it, you can’t help it.</p>
<p>You know, most pastors in the church do not tell their congregation to stop sinning. If you tell someone to stop sinning in the church today, they accuse you of being a legalist, being a pharisee, of being a preacher of self-righteousness, a preacher of works, but Jesus told people to sin no more. Jesus told people to be perfect. And that’s what we ought to hear from the pastors and from the pulpits today. Of course every man believes that you can avoid sinning, when they find out, that the pastor is committing adultery with their wife, at that point they think, “certainly you had the ability to avoid doing that”. How contradictory it is for any church to really get upset, when there’s a scandal with their pastor, but yet they believe you can’t stop sinning. Well if you can’t stop sinning, why are you so upset over the scandal?</p>
<p>Many in the church today, they live in compromise, they live in defeat, they have this defeatist mentality this defeatist attitude, of “I cant help but to sin”, “I’m always going to sin”, “I can’t stop sinning”, “I’m going to sin until the day I die”. And they have no victory, no freedom, no power.</p>
<p>You know, if I could not avoid sinning in this life, I wouldn’t want to life anymore, sin is so harmful, so destructive, so painful to our conscience, to our heart, to our soul, to our lives, that if I had to die to avoid sinning, I would want to die right now, I wouldn’t want to live anymore. And so that’s the result of that defeatist gospel message. But where’s the hope, where’s the deliverance? Where’s the victory? You see, by faith, we have victory. The Bible says, our faith purifies our heart. Our faith overcomes the world, the Bible says. We are justified and sanctified by faith. And so the message of the gospel is not one of defeat, it’s one of victory, it’s not one of bondage, it’s one of freedom. The Bible says, that he turns us from our iniquities, that he is able to keep us from falling. We’re supposed to pray, “deliver us from evil”. The message of the gospel is that through Jesus Christ we can be changed and transformed, become new people, turning from a life of sin to a life of holiness. That’s the message of the gospel. It’s not a message of sinning everyday. It’s a message of by faith and love and fear in God, obeying God every day. The Bible says we were servants of sin, but now we are servants of righteousness, you turned from darkness to light, that “you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free”, and “whom the son shall make free, is free indeed”.</p>
<p>And so the message of the gospel is not one of sinning everyday, of a lifestyle of sin, of practicing sin, the message of the gospel is one of turning from sin to God, from wickedness to holiness, from iniquity to righteousness. It’s one of freedom, one of hope, one of victory, not one of defeat, but one of conquery. “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me”. And if I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me, then certainly I can avoid sinning, I can stop sinning.</p>
<p>So many in the church today are living a life of compromise, they’re living a life of sin, living a life of perpetual wickedness, sinning everyday in word, thought and deed. It’s a lifestyle of sin. They’re practicing sin. And I think the root of the problem is this false theology, that says, “you can’t stop sinning”, “sin is inevitable”, “sin is unavoidable”. And they, ultimately, they undermine the work of the cross and they undermine the power of Gods grace.</p>
<p>There’s this theology of sinning, in fact the Westminster catechism says, no man is able either of himself or by any grace received in this life to perfectly keep Gods commandments, but he does daily break them in word, thought and deed. So here this Westminster-Calvinist-confession denies the power of the gospel. It denies the power of Gods grace. And Calvinism is supposed to be the doctrines of Grace. What a joke.</p>
<p>And so this false theology makes the power of sin greater than the power of Gods grace. Grace means that you don’t’ have to sin. The bible says, “sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law, but under grace”, and “shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? God forbid!” In other words, stop sinning. As Paul said “awake unto righteousness and sin not”. And so by grace we can avoid sinning. People hear in church that you can’t help it, you must sin until the day you die and it’s a false theology, it gives people false hope, false security and on judgment day, they’re going to find out they were fed a lie and they believed a lie and they have no excuse or justification for their sinning. But the truth of the matter is, that by love towards God, by faith in God, by fear in God, we can choose of our free will, not to sin.</p>
<p>I heard John Piper once say, that the greatest news he’s ever heard, is that the sins he’s going to commit next week, are already forgiven him, that that’s the greatest news he’s ever heard. I had two thoughts when I heard him say that.</p>
<p>My first thought was, oh I have better news than that, you don’t have to commit those sins next week, you can avoid those future potential sins, by Gods grace, by your free will, you can avoid sinning. God never allows you to be tempted above your ability, so you don’t have to commit those future sins. That’s a greater news than that, that’s good news. You don’t have to sin again.</p>
<p>And then secondly I thought, you know, what he was saying is good news, that’s not really good news at all, that’s tantamount to a license to sin. The idea that your future sins are already forgiven you, that implies that you’re forgiven without repentance. That implies that you’re forgiven while you’re in the very act of the sin, before you repent. And so that’s a false gospel.</p>
<p>The message of the gospel is that you need to repent of your sins, put your faith in Christ, and then persevere in the faith, persevere in holiness to stay saved, to abide in Christ, to continue and not to depart from the faith or backslide into sin. Certainly there is no salvation, no forgiveness, without repentance.</p>
<p>So my exhortation, my encouragement to you today is, don’t sin. When you’re tempted to sin, put your faith in Christ. When you’re tempted to sin, don’t put your faith in the devil. He’s trying to steal, kill and destroy. Why would you put your faith in him? But Christ on the other hand, he came to seek and to save those who are lost. He cares about you. So in the moment of temptation, don’t be like Adam and Eve, don’t believe the devil, believe God and consequently obey God. Like Abraham who was justified by faith, he believed God and he obeyed God.</p>
<p>So today, when you’re tempted, put your faith in Christ and have victory, put your faith in Christ and overcome, put your faith in Christ and don’t sin.</p>
