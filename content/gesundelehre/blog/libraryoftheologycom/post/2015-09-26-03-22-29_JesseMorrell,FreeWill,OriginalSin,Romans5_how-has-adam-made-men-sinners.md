# HOW HAS ADAM MADE MEN SINNERS?

### Jesse Morrell

### _(A section from the booklet "The Fall of Mankind")_

**ROMANS 5:19**

**"For as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners . . ."**

Through Adam's leading, influence, and example, men have voluntary chosen to become sinners of their own free will. Adam has provided the circumstances of temptation and the occasions to sin through his leading, influence, and example, though each man is the cause of his own sin, and is therefore accountable for his sin, and for his sin only. Adam provided the occasion of sin while each man is the cause of his own sin.

One man can wrongly influence another man, who wrongly influences another man, who wrongly influences another man, who wrongly influences another man, and on and on it goes. But if we were to trace all of these influences back as far as we can go, we would terminate upon Adam, who started this chain reaction, in the garden. So Adam has made many to sin by his leading, influence, and example.

It can also be argued that because of Adam's fall, all of his descendants inherit physical depravity which inclines them, influences them, and tempts them to sin, and in this way does Adam contribute to our choice to become sinners, though we ourselves voluntarily choose to obey those inclinations, influences, and temptations by our own free will.

Many Old Testament Kings "made Israel to sin" (1 Kng. 14:16; 15:26, 30, 34; 16:13, 26; 21:22; 22:52; 2 Kng. 3:3; 10:29, 31; 13:2; 14:24; 15:9, 18, 24, 28; 21:11, 16; 23:15); that is, through their leading, influence, and example they made Israel to sin. Foreign women caused King Solomon to sin (Neh. 13:26); that is, through their leading, influence, and example, Solomon decided to sin. By setting up high places of Baal, men caused Judah to sin (Jer. 32:35); that is, they sinned because of this leading, influence, and example. "My people have been lost sheep: their shepherds have caused them to go astray, they have gone astray" (Jer. 50:6) by their leading, influence, and example. Again, Israel had leaders who would "lead [them]" and "caused [them] to err" (Isa. 3:12) by their leading, influence, and example. Through a person's leading, influence, and example, a little child can be caused to sin (Matt. 18:6; Mk. 9:42; Lk. 17:2). The leading, influence, and example of a Christian can even cause a weaker brother to stumble (1 Cor. 8:9). And the bible says men could "fall" because of someone's "example of disobedience" (Heb. 4: 11) .

These are all cases in which someone can be "made" or "caused" to sin, or how man can "fall" into sin, through someone else's leading, influence, and example. Likewise, because of Adam's disobedience, "many were made sinners;" that is, through his leading, influence, and example, men voluntarily choose of their own free will to sin and to _become_ sinners, and thus _become_ spiritually dead (_relationally dead to God_) and rightly deserve eternal condemnation.

Men must take full responsibility for being sinners, "all have sinned" (Rom. 3:23). Becoming a sinner, becoming spiritually dead, and receiving eternal condemnation, is all conditional upon our own free will choice to rebel, disobey, or sin; just as becoming a saint, becoming born again, receiving eternal life at last is conditional upon our own free will choice to repent of sin, believe the gospel, and ultimately to persevere in obedient faith to the end. Men are made sinful because of Adam when they choose to rebel and men are made righteous because of Christ when they choose to convert. Condemnation and salvation are both conditional upon free will choices; neither condemnation nor salvation is universally automatic or unconditional.

"And God looked upon the earth and behold, it was corrupt; for all flesh had _corrupted_ _his way_ upon the earth." Gen. 6:12

"they have _corrupted themselves_" Exo. 32:7, Deut. 9:12, Deut. 32:5, Jdg. 2:19, Hos. 9: 9

"The Lord looked down from heaven upon the children of men to see if there were any that did understand and seek God. They are _all_ gone aside, they are all together _become_ filthy: there is none that doeth good, no not one." Ps. 14:2-3

"All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned _everyone to his own way__"_Isa. 53:6

"God hath _made man upright_: but _they_ have sought out many inventions." Ecc. 7:29

God is the author of our nature, that is, God is the author of our constitution (Isa. 49:5; Jer. 1:5; Ps. 139:13-14; Ecc. 7:29), so He forms each of us in the womb in His image (Gen. 1:26-27, 9:6). Therefore we are all created with a free will and a conscience, created capable of good or evil. Since God created us capable of moral action, capable of forming moral character, we are subjects of His Moral Government, intended to be governed by Him. The word nature can be used to describe a man's God given constitution (Rom 1:31, 2:14, 2:27; 2 Tim 3:3) or the word nature can mean a man's chosen character, custom, habit, or manner of life (Jer. 13:23; Acts 26:4; 1 Cor 2:14; Eph 2:2-3; Gal 2:15; 2 Tim 3:10; 2 Pet 1:4). While God is the author of our constitution, each man is the author or self-originator of their moral character (Ecc. 7:29; Matt. 12:34-35, 1 5 : 1 9 ; M k . 7 : 2 1 - 2 2 ; Lk . 6 : 4 5 ) .

The punishment of God is rightly executed upon willful rebellion (1 Sam. 3:13; Prov. 1:24-26; Hos. 9:9; Matt. 22:27; Lk. 10:27; Acts 3:23; Rom. 2:14-16; Heb 10:26-31; Eph. 5:6). Sin and guilt are not hereditary (Deut. 24:16; 2 Ki. 14:6; 2 Chron. 25:4; Eze. 18:2-4; Eze. 18:19-20; Jer. 31:29-30). Each man originates their own sin, each man is the author of their own moral character (Ecc. 7:29; Matt. 12:34-35, 15:19; Mk. 7:21-22; Lk. 6:45). Men are dead in sins, that is, they are separated from God and have a dead relationship, because they have each voluntarily chosen to sin (Isa. 59:2, Lk. 15:24; Rom. 5:12, Rom. 5:14, Rom. 7:9, Rom. 7:11, Col. 2:13). Men responsible for making themselves sinners (Gen. 6:12, Exo. 32:7, Deut. 9:12, Deut. 32:5, 1 Sam. 3:13; Jdg. 2:19, Hos. 9:9, Ps. 14:2-3, Isa. 53:6, Ecc. 7:29, Zep. 3:7, Rom. 3:23). Men are responsible for their own condemnation (Rom. 2:5; Heb. 2:2; 2 Pet. 2:13), sinners are accountable for their own sin (Deut. 24:16, 2 Kng. 14:6, 2 Chron. 25:4, Eze. 18:2-4, Eze. 18:19-20, Matt. 16:27, 2 Cor. 5:10, 2 Cor. 11:15, 1 Pet. 1:17, Rev. 22:12).
