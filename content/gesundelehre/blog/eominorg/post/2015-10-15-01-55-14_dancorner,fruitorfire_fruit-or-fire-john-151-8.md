## Jesus Taught _Fruit or Fire_

<big><big>**[Who Cuts Off The Fruitless Branches From Christ](#fruit%20or%20fire)**</big></big>

**One of the most misunderstood teachings from the Lord Jesus is this one. It could be rightly called his _fruit or fire_** teaching! This passage is _clear and to the point_, but **[false teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm)** have twisted these Scriptures and denied their clarity to preserve the heresy of _eternal security._ You are about to be stirred. Jesus said:

[![fruit or fire](../../files/pictures/PurpleGrapes.jpg "fruit or fire")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/goodworks.htm)

> <span class="inline-images">![1 John 15:1,2](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)</span><a name="fruit%20or%20fire"></a>I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. **He cuts off every branch in me that bears no fruit,** while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes so that it will be even more fruitful. (John 15:1,2)

**Fruit or fire!** Jesus is the _vine_, Christians are the _branches_ and the Heavenly Father is the _gardener_. **The Father cuts away the _fruitless_ branches from the life-sustaining _vine_ because of not bearing fruit and prunes the branches that are fruitful so they can be even more fruitful. (Clearly, God wants _fruit_ and such is a _vital requirement_ of remaining in the vine—staying saved. Remember, it's _fruit or fire_.)** 
**NOTE: Jesus said the _fruitless_ branches were _in me._ Hence, they were saved at one point.** This should end the _**[once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**_ slogan _in His grip,_ referring to an unconditional security and being safe in **[sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html)**, fruitlessness, etc. Clearly, **that is not an accurate understanding of the Heavenly Father.**

## [Find Out About Spiritual Good To Survive Rough Times Of Persecution](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-good.htm)

> <span class="inline-images">![1 John 15:3](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)</span>You are **already clean because of the word I have spoken to you.** (John 15:3)

Jesus is clearly speaking to those who _had been forgiven_ (spiritually cleansed). It is the same ones who got **_this life or death warning about bearing fruit._** The forgiven are the _branches._ The **[word of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wordgod.html)** brought that about. We are _born again_ through _**the word of God.**_ Peter wrote:

> For **you have been born again,** not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and enduring word of God. (1 Pet 1:23)

God's word is _imperishable, living_ and _enduring._ It must go forth for others to get _born again._

> <span class="inline-images">![1 John 15:4](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)</span>**Remain _in me,_ and I will remain in you.** No branch can bear fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you remain in me. (John 15:4)

**[God's sovereign](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/Godswill.htm)** will is for all the branches to _remain_ in the vine, **but the same [God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.html)** will also cut those same branches off if, through their own negligence, they become _unfruitful_. **If we _remain_ in the vine, the vine will remain in us. It is up to us to _remain_ in him and for our benefit to obey this command to _remain_. A Christian must remain in Christ (the vine) to be fruitful—the _only_ source of spiritual life.**

> <span class="inline-images">![1 John 15:5](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)</span>I am the vine; you are the branches. **IF a man remains in me and I in him,** he will bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. (John 15:5)

Again, Jesus mentions **his relationship to his followers is as _a vine to branches which can be cut off._** For the branches to get pruned by the gardener will enable them to bear more fruit. In other words, if a branch survives the gardener’s inspection and doesn’t get _cut off_ but just pruned, it will be very _fruitful._ 
**If a _pruned_ branch could speak, certainly it would say _the pruning was painful._ Perhaps some of the painful things that occur to fruitful Christians are part of the _pruning_ process.**



## The _Fruit or Fire_ Warning Is Real

[![Fruit or FIRE](../../files/pictures/GrapesBranch.jpg "fruit or fire")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html)

> <span class="inline-images">![1 John 15:6](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)</span>**If anyone does not remain _in me,_ he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, _thrown into the fire and burned._** (John 15:6)

[![FruitLESS Christians will be thrown into the FIRE.](../../files/pictures/fire.gif)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john_the_baptist.htm)

Jesus is clearly speaking about those who don’t remain (or continue) in Christ—the Christians who don’t produce good fruit, and therefore, get cut off by the Father. For them, as with us, it is **fruit or fire!** They died spiritually. The ones cut off were **not _[never really saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm)_** people, as the once saved always saved teachers might want us to believe. Instead, they were initially **_in the vine_,** that is, **_in Christ,_ the same as the other branches which continued in the vine. Both types of branches had the _same opportunity to be fruitful._**

The cut off branches **_withered_ after being severed from the vine,** just like what we would observe in the natural. See also Lk. 8:6\. **For a branch to _wither_ (or die) shows it had _life_ in it before then or it would be impossible for it to _wither_. Things that are dead and lifeless, such as a _rock,_ cannot _wither._**

Those branches are sustained by their connection to the vine. The cut off branches (Christians who lost their **[salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)** over _fruitlessness_) die spiritually and **get thrown into the _fire_.** Remember, it is **_fruit or fire_**. Their destiny is much different from the branches who remain in and with the vine. The branches remaining in the vine **continue to _live_ because of the vine.** This is just like:

> **He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.** (1 John 5:12)

Jesus is _eternal life._ It is impossible to have **[eternal life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternallife.html)** if we are don’t have Jesus.

> <span class="inline-images">![1 John 15:7](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)</span>If you remain in me and my words remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be given you. (John 15:7)

Verse 7 is a special prayer promise for the fruitful Christians—the ones who don’t get cut off. Such are commanded to ask (God) and it will be given to them. (A **[Christian](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html)** who has God’s word remaining in him is not going to ask for things outside God’s will.)

> <span class="inline-images">![1 John 15:8](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)</span>This is to my Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples. (John 15:8)

**The Father is glorified by _fruitfulness_.** That is also how one can be recognized as _a disciple of Christ._ This alone destroys the teaching of _once saved always saved._ **[Heretic Charles Stanley](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/stanlysc.html)** teaches the opposite of the Lord Jesus:

> ... a Christian who **at no point in his entire life bore any eternal fruit. And yet his salvation is never jeopardized** (_**[Eternal Security: Can You Be Sure](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-stanley.html)**_, p.121).

**A fruitless person will be _damned to [hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html)_, according to Jesus. It is **_fruit or fire!_**
