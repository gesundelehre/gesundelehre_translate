## All The Answers You Need When Witnessing To Mormons

[![mormonism joseph smith jr founder false prophet](../../files/pictures/joseph-smith-jr-click.jpg "mormonism joseph smith jr founder false prophet")](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormons.html)

The _Latter Day Saints_ (or _Mormons_) claim Mormonism is the one true church. They also claim to be true Christians and followers of Jesus Christ as they simultaneously embrace the doctrines set forth by their founder, **Joseph Smith Jr.** (1805-1844), whom they consider to be a _prophet._ In reality, **Joseph Smith, Jr. was a false prophet, who preached "another gospel" (Gal. 1:8,9) and was also condemned by the _Book of Mormon_ for his polygamy!** Joseph Smith, Jr. also translated a scroll with Egyptian characters on it and said it was the _Book of Abraham_ (written by the same Abraham in Genesis)! That too was falsefied in recent years, but remains part of the _Pearl of Great Price!_ Sadly, Mormons believe the truth of God has been rediscovered and restored by Joseph Smith since the Great Apostasy. In 1827, they believe Joseph Smith Jr. found (at the Hill Cumorah in New York), with the help of the angel _Moroni_, the golden tablets translated into the **Book of Mormon** - named after _Mormon_, who originally wrote it down.

To the Latter Day Saints, Joseph Smith's messages and especially the contents of the Book of Mormon are true and most precious. Remember that when witnessing to Mormons. Latter Day Saints claim it is in the Book of Mormon that one can learn the _everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ_ to have _salvation and eternal life,_ but these terms are not understood in a Biblical sense! Furthermore, **[LDS beliefs](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ldsbeliefs.htm) state that getting _eternal life_ is associated with believing in ("receiving") the Book of Mormon, while rejecting it brings _condemnation:_**

> And those who **receive it** [the Book of Mormon, v.8] in faith, and work righteousness, shall receive a **crown of eternal life**; But those who harden their hearts in unbelief, and **reject it, it shall turn to their own condemnation** (Doctrine and Covenants 20:14,15).

But remember, the **[Book of Mormon](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon-1.html)** condemns the founder of Mormonism, **[Joseph Smith, Jr.](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormons.html)**!

Besides the glaring contradiction of the Mormon celestrial marriage to the Bible (Mt. 22:29,30), another serious contradiction to God's word is about God himself:

[![](../../files/pictures/celestial-marriage-mormonism.jpg "mormonism celestial marriage")](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ldsbeliefs.htm)

> "Tell them this: **'These gods, who did not make the heavens and the earth, will perish from the earth and from under the heavens.**'" (Jer 10:11)

Mormons hope to be a God someday themselves, but their doctrine is again a major contradiction to God's eternal truth, for **_all gods who didn't make the heavens and the earth will perish!_** So are the Latter Day Saints real Christians? They certainly have beautiful temples, but does that mean they are Christians? The evidence to the contrary is clear and overwhelming. **Witnessing to Mormons** by proving **[Joseph Smith is a false prophet](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormons.html)** and the _**[Book of Mormon is NOT Scripture](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon-1.html)** is easier than many may think. Examine the evidence for yourself and make your own conclusions. Be assured, their view of _salvation_ and _eternal life_ do not mean the same as set forth in the Bible! **Mormons have a _different Jesus, gospel and Holy Spirit_ than Christians do. Moreover, Christians exalt the [Bible as final authority](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html), but the Latter Day Saints go instead by the _Book of Mormon, Doctrine and Covenants, The Pearl of Great Price and KJV Bible_, which contradict each other! Do NOT be deceived by Mormonism! Also, be assured there is NO need to [pray about the Book of Mormon](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon.htm)!**

![Moroni of mormonism](../../files/pictures/golden-moroni.jpg "Moroni of mormonism") 

**Sadly, Mormons have religious zeal, but not based on knowledge (Romans 10:2). [Mormons remain lost and bound to their sin addictions](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans6.html) -- without salvation and eternal life offered to all through sincere and humble repentance to God and a submissive faith in Jesus Christ (Acts 20:21; 26:20 cf. 1 John 5:12). Like so many church goers, Mormons know nothing about the [new creation in Christ](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/new-creation.html), a life free from [sin's slavery](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/slave.htm) and the very real dangers of hell fire awaiting them! Their view of the [Christian life](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-life.html) is totally unlike the one revealed in the Bible.**

## <a name="witnessing%20to%20mormons"></a>Latter-Day Saints Beliefs About Lucifer and Redemption

[![lds beliefs](../../files/pictures/lds-beliefs-mormon-beliefs.jpg "LDS beliefs include polytheism!")](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ldsbeliefs.htm)

**[Joseph Smith Jr.](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormons.html)** had a wild imagination to come up with the following story about redemption. In the Mormon Scriptures, _Pearl of Great Price,_ we read:

> And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying: That **Satan,** whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was from the beginning, and **he came before me, saying - Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.** But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me - Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever. Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mind Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down; And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice. (Moses 4:1-4)

**When witnessing to Mormons remember, Lucifer to them is the _spirit brother of Jesus_ who presented a plan of redemption to become the Savior of the world, but it was rejected by the Father and he became the devil!**
