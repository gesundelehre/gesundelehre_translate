## The _Gideon International_ Spreads FALSE Doctrine

[![The Gideon International Gets The Skull and Crossbones Award](../../files/pictures/snc.jpg)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm)

 _The Gideon International_ is the same group of business men who are known for giving away Bibles. Their headquarters in Nashville, TN had a _special edition_ of a book printed which teaches, among other things, the **demonic doctrine of _eternal security_**. This is what the _Gideon International_ has spread through that _special edition_ book:

> I say, "I just want you to know, my friend, the moment you invited Christ in your life, **you were saved. God guarantees that one day you will be with him in heaven."** (_Share Jesus Without Fear_ by William Fay, 1999 ed., p. 100, emphasis mine.)

That is the essence of _eternal security_ (also known as [**once saved always saved**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html), **the perseverance of the saints or the preservation of the saints).The message of the Gideon's International will lull one to sleep, take him off his spiritual guard and quickly help to bring him to his [spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html) through sin.**

Furthermore, on the inside back cover of the Gideon International New Testaments is the bold heading, _**Assurance As a Believer.**_ (See picture below.) Under that heading are various Scriptures that have been typically misused for support of the _eternal security_ doctrine.

**Sadly, the _Gideon International_ has listed no _warnings_ or _conditions_ for salvation as mentioned in Mt. 10:22; Heb. 3:6,14; Rev. 2:10,11; 22:19; etc.:**

> All men will **hate** you because of me, but **he who stands firm to the end will be saved.** (Mat 10:22)

> But Christ is faithful as a son over God's house. And **we are his house, if we hold on to our courage and the hope of which we boast.** (Heb 3:6)

> **We have come to share in Christ IF we hold firmly till the end** the confidence we had at first. (Heb 3:14)

**People given a Gideon Bible are being presented, therefore, with a _dangerously_ misleading partial truth as the whole truth which can be MISLEADING AND DEADLY.**

## The Inside Back Covers of Gideon Bibles Are Spreading DEADLY Deceptions

[![gideon international](../../files/pictures/gideon-bible-easy-believism-eternal-security.jpg "The Gideon International promotes DAMNABLE HERESY with their no repentance, easy believism and eternal security salvation message.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm)

Carefully examine the inside back cover of the Gideon New Testaments, pictured to the left. It is just like a DECEPTIVE gospel tract of our dark hour, even though it is attached to the New Testament. Three areas are marked with red arrows. **The scriptures they cite for salvation omit _repentance!_ Therefore, just on that basis, the Gideon International is dangerously misleading people who want salvation. Unless one repents, he will perish (2 Pet. 3:9; Luke 13:3, etc.). That makes their so-called _God's Remedy For Sin_ ineffective! The new creation in Christ does not change someone simply if he has mental assent or demon faith. It takes repentance and a sincere heart-felt commitment to the Lord Jesus Christ to follow and serve him here and now, but that is NOT their message, as you can see!** Moreover, they reference 1 Cor. 15:3,4, but omit the clear conditional security for the believer founded on the gospel itself:

> By this gospel you are saved, **if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.** (1 Cor 15:2)

The inescapable conclusion from God's word regarding the gospel is that the believer's security is CONDITIONAL. Like it or not that is part of the real Christian gospel, which is part of the context of 1 Cor. 15:3,4, but omitted by the Gideon International. **If you are a Christian and a member of the _Gideon International_, rather than helping to spread such vile doctrines by belonging to this group, you should be fighting against it. Jude 3,4 command Christians to _contend against_ this counterfeit _grace,[another gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html)_ and _license for immorality._ (Special thanks to J. R. for bringing the above quotes about the _Gideon International_ to our attention.)**
