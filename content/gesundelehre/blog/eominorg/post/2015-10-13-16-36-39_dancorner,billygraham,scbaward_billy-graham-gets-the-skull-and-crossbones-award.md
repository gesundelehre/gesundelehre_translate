## _Billy Graham Evangelistic Association_ Is Spreading Both Truth and <font color="red">DEADLY POISON</font>

<big><big>**[Billy Graham EXPOSED His Own SHOCKING Heresies With Larry King](#billy%20graham%20evangelistic%20association)**</big></big> 

**World famous Southern Baptist Billy Graham, born in 1918, gets the _Skull And Crossbones Award_ for multiple reasons. First, his _Billy Graham Evangelistic Association_ changes the grace of God into a "license for immorality" (Jude 4) with the following statement, which is the language of eternal security:**

![Billy Graham Gets The Skull and Crossbones Award](../../files/pictures/snc.jpg)

> "When we do sin, God does not reject us or disown us. **Our fellowship with Him may be broken, but our relationship is not**; we are still members of His family if we have truly committed our lives to Christ" (Billy Graham Evangelistic Association Salvation Q & A Index #9, Frequently Asked Questions, Internet.)

This is a fine-sounding argument (Col. 2:4) but the Word of God declares something different about what sin can do to a believer. Scripture reveals that much more than just our fellowship is jeopardized by sin:

> "Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. **The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life**" (Gal. 6:8).

> "For **if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die**; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live" (Rom. 8:13).

**[Once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** is the essence of the devil's first lie to mankind (Gen. 3:4) denying **[spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)** to the righteous through sin. Remember it was true grace teaching that gave us the following:

> "The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. **I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this [will not inherit the kingdom of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/will-not-inherit-the-kingdom-of-God.htm)**" (Gal. 5:19-21).



## Billy Graham Catholicism

<big>**[Pope John Paul II Promoted by non-Catholics](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/popejohnpaul.htm)**</big>

**[Once saved always saved Billy Graham](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** is also a major compromiser with the Catholic Church. He has helped to **[promote Catholicism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/official.html)** by exalting **[Pope John Paul II](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/pope-john-paul-II.html)** and others. His endorsement of such a pagan system has, no doubt, stumbled multitudes.

### <a name="billy%20graham%20evangelistic%20association"></a>Billy Graham With Larry King

Billy Graham deserves the _Skull and Crossbones Award_ just for his **[Catholic](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html)** compromise. The following is indisputable proof from a dialog between Larry King and Billy Graham:

> **Larry King:** There is no question in your mind that he [Pope John Paul II] is with God now?
> 
> **Billy Graham: Oh, no. There may be a question about my own,** but I don't think Cardinal Wojtyla, or the Pope - **I think he's with the Lord,** because he believed. He believed in the Cross. That was his focus throughout his ministry, the Cross, no matter if you were talking to him from personal issue or an ethical problem, he felt that there was the answer to all of our problems, the cross and the resurrection. And he was a strong believer. (http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0504/02/lkl.01.html)



## Oops, Did Billy Graham Forget?

**Billy Graham is not sure of his own salvation, but is sure about the Pope's! Did Billy Graham forget he believes in _[once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)?_** Later in the same King interview, Catholic compromising Billy Graham stated:

> And then my son, Franklin, will be going to the enthronement of the new Pope.

Billy Graham and his _Billy Graham Evangelistic Association_, with his son Franklin Graham, has been one of the chief promoters of the **[false unity with Rome](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/unity.html)**. He continues to be exalted and respected despite the spiritual harm he has caused through that alone! People need to know the truth. IF Billy Graham was ever saved, he is now an **[apostate](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/tragedies.html)**, for he turned away from Christian doctrine and practice, just like **[David Wilkerson](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/david-wilkerson-it-is-finished-book.html)** did during his latter years. **For your own sake, avoid Billy Graham and his _Billy Graham Evangelistic Association_!**
