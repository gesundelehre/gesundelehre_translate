**If you are acquainted with _Roman Catholic doctrine_ and the message of the Bible, you are aware of the _irreconcilable serious differences_ between the two and lethal _Catholic deception_.**

Some of the areas are lesser in significance and will not be cited here. On the other hand, some are clearly related to _salvation_. **It is important, especially for Catholics, to know about the most serious false teachings they have been taught so they can make the vital needed changes and find the only _salvation_ the **[Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)** offers. Catholic deception is very common in our day. Without doubt, there are millions of Roman Catholics, past and present who have accepted the following as fact to their own harm.**

## _Born Again_ At Infant Baptism

**Roman Catholics are dangerously taught they were _born again_ at [infant baptism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/infantbaptism.htm). That single Roman Catholic doctrine alone has surely been responsible for hundreds of millions of Catholics going to _hell_ over the centuries.** Folks, if you think you already have what is needed to enter God’s kingdom, you won’t be trying to find it. In their minds, Catholics think they got this when they were _babies,_ without repentance and faith in Jesus. The truth is, one gets Biblically _born again_ **only** when he turns away from his sins and places his faith in the Lord Jesus to the point of dedication and commitment. The concept of _infant baptism_ is not found anywhere in the Bible.


## _Receive Christ_ At Communion

**Roman Catholics dangerously think they _receive Christ_ when they partake of the communion wafer ([Eucharist](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/eucharist.htm)**). This false and deadly concept is the result of the bogus idea that the communion elements (bread and wine) have been _transubstantiated_ by the priest into the _literal body, blood, soul and divinity of Jesus Christ._ This has also led people into the _worship_ of the consecrated communion wafer as one would _worship_ God himself. Hence, the fruit of this false doctrine is also _idolatry_, a soul-damning sin. The truth is: one _receives_ Christ when he _believes on his name_ (John 1:12). This is another way of saying when one _turns from his idols to serve the true and living God_ (1 Thess. 1:9). (No one _receives_ Christ in his mouth, then swallows him to be digested.)


## Claims Jesus Founded Roman Catholicism

[![was peter the first pope](../../files/pictures/peter-was-not-first-pope.jpg "was peter the first pope")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/peter.html)

Roman Catholics wrongly think their church system was founded by Jesus on **[Peter the first pope](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/peter.html)**.

![catholic priest catholic deception](../../files/pictures/catholic-priest.jpg)

The _superiority_ the Roman Catholic Church claims for itself comes from this fallacious concept, which has led people into increasing error especially as Catholicism has drifted further and further into darkness over the centuries. Most Catholics are not aware of the doctrines that were added over the centuries or that certain popes were denounced as _heretics_ by other popes. **The whole idea of a papacy itself is unscriptural. After Jesus spoke Mt. 16:18, Peter was _not_ recognized as the _chief_ Apostle among the Twelve.** Mk. 8:29 is the parallel account to Mt. 16:18\. Less than one full chapter later, the disciples were _arguing which of them was the greatest_ (Mk. 9:24). Hence, they didn’t understand Peter to be the chief. See also Acts 15 where Peter did _not_ preside over the Jerusalem church council.


## Catholics Think Mary is _Our Life, Sweetness and Hope_

**_Roman Catholic doctrine_ declares [Mary](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/mother-of-Jesus.html) is their _life, sweetness and hope_ and openly proclaim her as such when they recite the [Rosary](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/rosary.html), which they say is the _epitome of the whole gospel._**![blessed virgin mary catholic deception](../../files/pictures/mary.jpg)The idea that Mary could possibly be _our life, sweetness and hope_ is impossible, according to the pages of the New Testament. Catholicism has erected a false Mary, which has a primary role in people’s salvation. Such has misled many sincere people. The truth is: Mary plays absolutely _no role_ in our salvation. For one to become Biblically saved, he will have to place all 100% of his faith (a submissive faith) in the Lord Jesus or he will be damned. This means you cannot trust in being a Catholic, the sacraments and/or Mary along with the Lord Jesus.

[![catechism of the catholic church mary](../../files/pictures/catechism-of-the-catholic-church-grace.jpg "Mary is NOT the mediatrix and dispenser of all grace. God is! That catholic deception is directly linked to salvation.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/mary.html)

 You must trust in Jesus alone (100%). That implies a turning away from your sins.

## Catholic Deception - Saved By Wearing The _Brown Scapular_

**Catholics think if they die wearing the _**[brown scapular](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/brown-scapular.html)**_ they will not suffer the _fires of hell._** Such a teaching is so strange that it is hard to believe anyone would accept it, but this is what Catholics have been taught. Such a teaching also reflects the spiritual inabilities and darkness of their hierarchy (papacy) for allowing this dangerous concept to be taught as truth.


## Sacraments and Salvation

![eucharist catholic deception](../../files/pictures/eucharist2.jpg)Catholics think the sacraments are a means of them receiving _grace_ needed for salvation. Because Catholics have been taught this way, they are **_trusting in the sacraments for salvation_** instead of the Lord Jesus as the Bible declares. Such a false teaching has also placed the Catholic in the mind set of thinking he must remain in the Catholic system to go to _Penance_ and get communion _(Holy Eucharist),_ which they also think should be.


## Catholics Confess Sins To Their Priest Instead of God

![priest denies own teaching](../../files/pictures/PRIEST_N.png)

Catholics confess their sins to a priest instead of to God. This false concept goes back again to the false authority the papacy (and its priesthood) claims for itself. The Bible speaks of a _royal priesthood_ for all believers (1 Pet. 2:9). There is no unique priesthood with the ability to forgive sins. We can go directly to God, without a priest or Mary and get forgiven, if we go in repentance, sincerity and humility (Luke 18:13,14).


## Fatima Marian Vision Deception

Catholics who read and believe the **[Fatima Visions](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/fatima.html) are dangerously thinking that Mary is _our refuge and the way_ that will lead us to God.

[![fatima marian apparition](../../files/pictures/fatima-apparition-demon.jpg "fatima marian apparition")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/fatima.html)

There is no way to calculate how many sincere people have been misled by Roman Catholic Marian visions, which they have endorsed as being _from God._** Of all of these, perhaps the most misleading are the Fatima, Portugal visions, which would have one look to _Mary_ for his _refuge_ and _the way_ to God. Such an error is a sure way to miss God’s paradise kingdom and end up in hell God is our _refuge_ and Jesus is _the only way_ to God (Psa. 16:1; John 14:6; etc.).


## Roman Catholic Doctrine - False Hope of _Purgatory_

Many Catholics are just hoping to enter _Purgatory_ and there get purged of their sins to afterwards get to Heaven. Because the Catholic Church teaches the purging of sins _after_ physical death in the fires of _Purgatory_, many Catholics are only hoping to get there and afterwards make their way to heaven. Folks, there is no such place as _Purgatory._ We can only get cleansed from our sins by contacting the blood of Jesus when we repent and have faith. After getting born again, we must forgive others who sin against us (Mt. 6:14,15) and confess the sins to God (1 John 1:9).


## False and Sinful Way To _Love_ Jesus

Catholics have been lethally misinformed about how to show their _love_ for the Lord Jesus. Catholics wrongly think they show their love for Jesus by _bowing_ before an image (they think is of him) and _kissing_ that image. The truth is: we show our love for Jesus by _obeying his commands_ (John 14:15), and bowing before images is _disobedience_ and _idolatry_ (Exodus 20:4-6). For any person, Catholic or non-Catholic, to benefit by the vital truths about salvation, as found in the Bible, it will take a sincere and humble heart which loves and wants God's truth. The clear message of **[salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)** as found in the Bible centers around Jesus Christ. We must have a faith that will loyally following him _until death_ for an entrance into God's kingdom. (There is no **[once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html).)
