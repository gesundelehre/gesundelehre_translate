## Who Is The Real Ray Comfort Of _Living Waters_ and _The Way of The Master?_

**_Ray Comfort_ (born in 1949) of _Living Waters_ and _The Way of the Master_ is a glib speaker from New Zealand who is held up as a [Christian evangelism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-evangelism.htm) expert. Unfortunately, Ray Comfort has many people (especially the Full Gospel, Pentecostal crowd) deceived about his _salvation_ message (or gospel).** As shown in his tape, _Hell's Best Kept Secret,_ he believes in **[once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.htm)**. Consequently, he teaches identically with the devil who wanted Eve to think she would not **[die spiritually through sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/diespiritually.htm)**. See Gen. 3:4.

## _Ray Comfort_ Quotes

![Ray Comfort Gets The Skull And Crossbones Award](./../files/pictures/snc.jpg "Ray Comfort gets the skull and crossbones award.")

> "What it is, is a sad admission to the amount of confidence we have in the power of our message and in the keeping power of God. If God has saved them, God will keep them. **If they're born of God, they'll never die**. If he's [**begun a good work in them, he'll complete it to that Day**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/phil1.6.htm). If he is the author of their faith, he'll be the finisher of their faith. He's able to save to the uttermost them that come to God by him. He's able to keep them from falling and to present them faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy. Jesus said **[no one will pluck you from my Father's hand](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john1028.htm)**." (_**Hell's Best Kept Secret**_ by Ray Comfort, audio tape) [To hear Ray Comfort speak that, and change _grace_ into a license to sin, click **[_Ray Comfort Ministries Is Spreading The HERESY of Eternal Security_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/audio/ray-comfort-eternal-security-hells-best-kept-secret.mp3)**.]

[![ray comfort living waters way of the master](../../files/pictures/ray-comfort-evangelism-spiritual-death.jpg "Ray Comfort denies the righteous will die spiritually [lose salvation] if they turn to evil.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.htm)

**That is [Eternal Security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.htm) teaching with its Scriptural distortions. Therefore, Ray Comfort is unable to adequately teach evangelism and warn the righteous, because of his denial of spiritual death for the righteous who turn to evil (Ezek. 33:18). Sadly, Ray Comfort thinks, _If they're born of God they will never die._ (The real _Hell's best kept secret_ is that the Christian _can_ [die spiritually](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/diespiritually.htm) through sin, so don't be deceived by him.) Hence, Ray Comfort is opposed to _following up_ on his [New Converts](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/newconverts.htm). In contrast, the Apostle Paul's theology prompted him to follow up on his converts which resulted in his second and third missionary journeys. Of those real converts he saw people _fall from grace_ (Gal. 5:2-4), _shipwreck their faith_ (1 Tim. 1:19), _wander away from a pure heart, good conscience and a sincere faith_ (1 Tim. 1:5,6), _turn from their dedication to Christ to following Satan_ (1 Tim. 5:15), etc. So the issue isn't just true or [False Conversion](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/falseconversion.htm), as Ray Comfort implies. New Christians can be in great danger of slick talking, Scripture-quoting false prophets. After someone gets saved, and we can _know_ who is a child of God and who is a child of the devil (1 John 3:10). New converts need spiritual care, which can prevent them from falling away ([Spiritual Death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.htm)), as many others have in the past.** Jesus taught:

> All men will hate you because of me, but **he who stands firm to the end will be saved** (Mat 10:22).

> But whoever disowns me before men, **I will disown him before my Father in heaven.** (Mat 10:33)

> For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But **if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.** (Mat 6:14,15)

> ...They believe for a while, but **in the time of testing they fall away**. (Luke 8:13)

> **If anyone does not remain in me, he is like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are picked up, thrown into the fire and burned.** (John 15:6)

> So then **because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth.** (Rev 3:16, KJV)

## Ray Comfort At The Southern Baptist State Conferences and Moody Bible!

**_Ray Comfort_ is a regular platform speaker at _Southern Baptist State Conferences._ Ray Comfort tracts and Living Waters literature is used by the _Moody Bible Institute._** Both of these institutions are known for teaching the extreme version of _eternal security._ (Read **[Ray Comfort's Evangelistic Approach is Flawed](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ray-comfort.htm).) For Ray Comfort to speak there is proof that they must agree with him! Because he teaches like they do about the believer's security, he, therefore, deserves the _Skull and Crossbones Award_ for his HERESY!**

NOTE: Though Ray Comfort may rant and rave about being EXPOSED on this page, what has he taught refuting the damnable lie of eternal security and showing a saved person can lose his salvation? NOTHING! How then can he teach the real gospel of grace? **What kind of _Living Waters_ does he have? How can he really be declaring the _Way of the Master_?**

> By this gospel you are saved, **IF you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.** (1 Cor 15:2)

> **We have come to share in Christ IF we hold firmly till the end** the confidence we had at first. (Heb 3:14)

## My Email Ray Comfort Never Did (Or Cannot) Respond To

Ray Comfort:

Greetings in Jesus' holy name.

It has been our experience that there are two types of OSAS people: (1) those like Charles Stanley that consistently teach a license for immorality and **(2) those like John MacArthur (and other Calvinists) that only appear to teach a license for immorality on occasions.**

Type two OSAS believer (also known as eternal security or the perseverance of the saints) will **at times seem that he is teaching holiness and stresses true or false conversion.** However, he flatly denies a true Christian can lose his salvation. He would say when someone with a convincing testimony turns away from God that had been faithful even for years, that person was **[never really saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm). This type is very easy to smoke out by asking a few easy questions, which these people usually don't like to answer so that they won't be exposed. (They like to give the impression of [holiness preaching](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/holiness-preaching.htm) when they are not.) Here are the six easy questions:**

**(1) Was King David saved before he fell into adultery and murder? YES or NO.**

**(2) Was [King David](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.htm) still saved while in adultery and murder and before he repented? YES or NO.**

**(3) Had King David died physically when in adultery and murder would he have gone to hell? YES or NO.**

**(4) Is it possible that a real Christian can lose his salvation? YES or NO.**

**(5) Did Peter lose his salvation when he disowned Jesus three times? YES or NO.**

**(6) Did Solomon lose his salvation when his heart turned to idolatry? YES or NO.**

Furthermore, you deny that a righteous person can die spiritually, just like ALL OSAS teachers. That is the actual quote we have of you in our radio broadcasts. Do you deny that this is your intended meaning? Ray, _hell's best kept secret_ is that eternal security is of the devil!

Contending For The Faith,

* * *

[The following is a comment which was not part of the email to him.] Ray Comfort has actually gone on record to say, "I do believe in eternal security ..." and "The true convert is eternally secure in his faith ...." Ray Comfort goes on to say that "if a man steals, lies, kills, rapes, hates, lusts, covets, commits adultery, etc., and calls himself a Christian, he would be very wise to examine himself and see IF he is ‘IN THE FAITH'" (emphasis ours). COMMENT: It seems that Ray Comfort is not sure if such a person that steals, lies, kills, rapes, commits adultery, etc. is saved or not! The truth is, all those cited in 1 Cor. 6:9,10; Rev. 21:8; Eph. 5:5-7; Gal. 5:19-21 will end up in Hell unless they turn from these sins and live pure before God.

### Emails We Received About _Ray Comfort_

> I must confess to you I thought Ray Comfort was the best evangelist in the world ... until I found out he was a Soundly Saved ... OSAS teacher ... He is very likable and from what _____________ has said ... His ministry is a multi-million Dollar Business ... I live about 25 minutes from his ministry and I have visited there and it is true ... his business is booming with Stores in many other countries as well ... I also had Evangelical Outreach send a packet of your ministry CD'S and samples of your tracts to Kirk Cameron ... I feel if we can influence Kirk with the truth then maybe we can turn Ray Comfort too ... so if your ministry gets an angry letter or phone call from Kirk then please let Him know that it was me just trying to show him the truth. Kirk has been sucked into Ray Comfort's ministry just like most of us were ... and thanks to you ... you have exposed Ray Comfort and all his false teachings ... I just want to say thanks for being such a good student of the scriptures ... you have and will continue to save many people from these False Teachings from Hell ...

> ### _Ray Comfort's Views on Eternal Security Are Wrong_
> 
> Thank you for your ministry. A year ago I was really getting into Ray Comfort's teachings on evangelism. Ray Comfort highly esteems [**Charles Spurgeon**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spurgeon.htm), and as a result i started studying Spurgeon's teachings. I found that he believed in eternal security and predestination to heaven or hell. I did not really agree with such views but I had never given it much thought before, so i did not dismiss them as being false. A couple days later, however, my dad wanted me to look up some information on [**Erwin Lutzer**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/erwin-lutzer.htm) because he enjoyed a book written by him. I typed his name on a search engine on the internet and your Evangelical Outreach site came up. I clicked on it and found a rebuttal to the argument I had read a few days earlier by Spurgeon for eternal security and predestination. I think it was God that led me to your site. I was able to see that Spurgeon's and Ray Comfort's views on eternal security are wrong, and I have since become more careful about fearing God. Thank you for your ministry ... Sincerely.

> I thought that it would be of some interest to you to know that I used to be a big fan of Ray Comfort, until I heard him speak on the believer's security. He calls it true and false conversion. **I used to buy his tracts and hand them out, but I no longer feel comfortable doing so, because someone may be deceived into believing that his teaching on salvation is the truth.** It really saddens me, because he really does have some great tracts and he definetely [sic] has a zeal for the lost. I just don't understand how anyone who claims to read their bible everyday can believe the OSAS (once saved always saved) lie.
