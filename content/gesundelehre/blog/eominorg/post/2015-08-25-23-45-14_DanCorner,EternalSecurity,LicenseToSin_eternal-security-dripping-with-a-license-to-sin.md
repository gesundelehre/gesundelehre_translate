## Godless Men Have Changed _Grace_ Into A _License To Sin_

**Be assured that the [eternal security teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html) will usually deny that their doctrine is _a license for immorality_ (or _license to sin)_, but that doesn’t change reality. (One exception to this denial is [heretic David J. Stewart](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/hereticDavidJStewart.html), who admits to teaching a _license to sin!_) There are various ways we can know the truth about this doctrine which is so dearly embraced by the deceived multitudes. Here are a few concepts that should drive home this revealing point about eternal security being _a license to sin:_**

## The Prodigal

In the teaching of the **[Prodigal Son](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/prodigal-son.html)**, the Lord Jesus taught the youngest son departed from the presence of the Father to go into _wild living_, which included being with _prostitutes_. He spent all his wealth, then came to his senses. At that point he humbly returned to the Father (and turned away from his wickedness) to serve God. The Father ran to welcome him back and shared the most important truths about this topic in verses 24 and 32:

> For this son of mine **was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.** So they began to celebrate. (Luke 15:24)

> But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours **was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.** (Luke 15:32)

[![license to sin](../../files/pictures/license-to-sin.jpg "A license to sin = eternal security!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/acid_test.html)

It should be clear from these verses that the Prodigal’s spiritual condition went from **saved to lost** when sexually immoral **to saved again** when he **[repented](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)** to serve God. **The Father clearly stated the Prodigal was spiritually _dead_ and _lost_ when in wild living.** This is both clear and destructive to the doctrine of eternal security because the prodigal **_[died](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)_ [ spiritually](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)** through sin. **Hence, he was back on the road to _hell_ again.**

Obviously, the eternal security proponents deny that the prodigal _lost_ his salvation. **To do otherwise would be to reject their own doctrine.** (Their sole feeble argument is that he always remained the Father’s son **even when in _wicked_ living.** It seems that they intentionally miss the truths that he was both **spiritually _dead_ and _lost_ when in his sins.**)

**Here’s the point:** When the eternal security proponents argue that the prodigal didn’t lose his salvation, they are at the same time arguing that **one can _habitually sin_ in _wild living_ as the prodigal did.** To be more exact, **they are indirectly saying Christians can be visiting _[prostitutes](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/prostitution.htm)_ and do other _wild_ things as the Prodigal when spiritually dead and lost (Lk. 15:24) and still remain on the road to heaven as a Christian!** This is clearly a _license for immorality, license to sin_ and _not grace, God’s keeping power, etc._ Their doctrine can't justly be equated with **[eternal salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/getsaved.html). Again, to deny that the Prodigal lost his salvation when in sexual sin is _to affirm that one can be as sexually immoral and wild as he was and have spiritual life at the same time_—clearly a license to sin (and [doctrine of demons](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/doctrine-of-demons.html)).**



## The Way They Teach Romans 7:14-25 Implies a _License To Sin_

If you have ever had much of a conversation with closed eternal security advocates, it is highly likely that they brought up Romans 7:14-25 and tried to apply that to the Apostle Paul **when a _Christian_.**

[![license to sin](../../files/pictures/license-to-sin-and-sin.jpg "OSAS people most often deny their lince to sin.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/practice-sin.htm)

To do this is to ignore at least a dozen Scriptures which are as crystal clear as they come in showing **Paul lived a consistently holy and exemplary, self-denying Christian life.** Such relevant Scriptures are ignored and avoided when Romans 7:14-25 is cited as backing for their security in sin teaching of eternal security. (This automatically shows there is something very wrong in the **_heart_** of these teachers.)

It also reveals how **_ignorant_** of the Bible these teachers are and their audience who accepts their sinister interpretation of Romans 7:14-25\. **The truth is, Paul was the _champion_ apostle of all times and the _ultimate example_ of a Christian, but these people describe him as basically the _lowest of the low—the [chief of sinners](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/worst-of-sinners.htm) after getting saved!_ Please notice the following verse from that Romans 7 passage:**

> For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, **the evil I do not want to do—this I keep on doing.** (Verse 19)

What is so revealing in verse 19 is: **_if_** that is supposed to be Paul as a Christian, as the eternal security teachers want us to believe, then:

a) Paul, the Christian, **continually** did **_not_** do the good he wanted to do (which conflicts with Titus 2:14; etc.) and

b) Paul, the Christian, **continually did _evil_.**

Ponder those truths. This is another way of saying **Paul as a Christian, _habitually_ and _continually practiced_ sin as an _unbroken lifestyle_,  the very thing the Calvinist eternal security proponents _deny_ a true Christian can do at other times!** (The eternal security teachers declare **opposite messages** at different times depending on what is most convenient **at the moment.** Their listeners either don’t care about these contradictions or aren’t able to recognize them.)

Furthermore, Jesus spoke of religious people in Matthew 7:21-23 that were **continuous tense evil doers (just like Rom. 7:19 describes). Jesus said of the ones in Mt. 7:21-23 that he _never_ knew them—meaning they had never come to salvation.** But here in Rom. 7:14-25, the eternal security teachers are going contrary to their own teachings and Mt. 7:21-23 to allow for **continuous tense wicked _lifestyle_ living for Paul as a Christian, who wrote half of the New Testament!** Clearly, for them to misuse Romans 7:14-25 the way they do is to teach **a license for immorality**  (besides smearing Paul’s Godly image and distorting the holy image of a true Christian as a whole). Their license to sin will trample on any Biblical character it can!

## 1 Cor. 5:1-5 and a License To Sin

In 1 Cor. 5:1-5 there was an unnamed sexually immoral man in the Corinthian congregation who was guilty of sexual sin **not even named among the pagans of Paul’s day—incest and adultery. The eternal security teachers argue from verse 5 that he had spiritual life while in unrepentant continuous sexual immorality. By doing that,** they are indirectly saying that **a Christian can live the same way and be _more_ sinfully wicked than pagans! At other times the eternal security teachers will say that not everyone in a particular church group is a _Christian_, but here they declare this incestuous wicked man was a Christian. Imagine that! What a _license to sin_ that is!**

[![license to sin](../../files/pictures/sin-unto-death-eternal-security-click.jpg "The OSAS sin unto death is a definite license to sin.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/sinuntodeath.html)

**[There is another exception, which needs to be mentioned. The exception to this license to sin implication from 1 Cor.5:1-5 comes from [David Pawson](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/david_pawson.html), a teacher who rejects eternal security! NOTE: Though David Pawson rejects eternal security he is still teaching the same DEADLY WAY. [Robert Shank in _Life in The Son_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/robert-shank.html) also taught a license to sin! [Jimmy Swaggart](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/jimmy-swaggart-study-in-the-word.htm) has his twist too. Swaggart rejects _unconditional eternal security_, but says he believes in _conditional eternal security_, which he teaches as NO SIN, regardless what it is, can negate a Christian's salvation! Hence, such teachers are no better than the open and bold once saved always saved teachers for they too are a snare to precious SOULS.]**

## The License To Sin is Implied

In conclusion, just from the aforementioned three passages, **the eternal security teachers believe a _Christian_ can be one who is living wildly and visiting _prostitutes_** (like the Prodigal) **_,continuously_ _doing_ _evil_ as an unbroken _lifestyle_** (as they interpret Rom. 7:14-25) **and _incestuously worse than pagans_** (as the man in [**1 Cor. 5:1-5**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/1cor55_calvinism.htm)).

Hence, eternal security teachers are **guilty of teaching and defending a _license to sin_** (and often do this under their false understanding of _grace)_. This shows also they are described by the [**book of Jude**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/Jude.htm), especially verses 3 and 4\. (How they view David, when in adultery and murder, and their erroneous understanding of the _[**sin unto death**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/sinuntodeath.html)_ also confirms their **_license to sin._ You can also add to that, that they think backsliden King Saul died with salvation, both Lot and Noah had salvation when in _drunkenness_ and Peter remained saved even after he _disowned Jesus_ and before he repented!**)

**Eternal security teachers are dangerous people**  declaring _**demonic** teachings_ under the guise of _grace, God’s keeping power, God’s love, God’s faithfulness, etc. Their gospel is [**another gospel**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html) and a license for sin._ Dear reader, if you are a real Christian do **_not_** support their ministry and/or churches. If you do, you are part of the problem and partly responsible for all the **harm** they are doing with their _license to sin_ teachings.
