## Do You Really Know What John MacArthur Teaches?

**Calvinist, John MacArthur gets the _Skull and Crossbones Award_ for changing the grace of God into a "license for immorality" (Jude 4) with the following statements:**

> Yes, someone says, but can't Christians put themselves outside God's grace? What about those who commit **abominable sins**? Don't they nullify the work of redemption in themselves? Don't they forfeit the love of God? **Certainly not** ... **it's preposterous to think that we can forfeit it [salvation] by anything we do.** (John MacArthur, Jr., _The Love of God_, Word Publishing, 1996, p. 159, emphasis mine)

> Believers will **often fall into sin,** but their **sin is not more powerful than God's grace.** (John MacArthur, Jr., _Saved Without A Doubt_, Chariot Victor Publishing, 1982, p. 45, emphasis mine)

## John MacArthur Is WORSE Than Charles Stanley

Here is a **[Charles Stanley direct](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-stanley.html)** quote, _You cannot outsin the grace of God_. John MacArthur teaches the same similar way! In fact, John MacArthur teaches **WORSE** by also saying believers _often fall into sin_. Don't misinderstand John MacArthur's doctrine. He teaches a **[license to sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/etlicense.html)** as a Calvinist. The above is clear proof, but there is even more. In his so-called "Study Bible" under his comments on 1 Cor. 6:9-11, John MacArthur comments:

[![John MacArthur](../../files/pictures/JohnMac.bmp)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/johnmacarthur.htm)

> Some who used to have those patterns of sinful life were falling into those old sins again, and needed reminding that **if they went all the way back to live as they used to** they were not going to inherit **[eternal salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/getsaved.html)**, because it would indicate that they never were saved (The MacArthur Study Bible, 1997, p. 1736)

NOTE: The listing of sins in 1 Cor. 6:9,10 identifies the _unrighteous_, not believers, but John MacArthur shockingly declares that **a true Christian can commit ALL of those sins!** However, the true Christian can't go _all the way back_ as before, for that would prove he was **[never really saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm)** after all, according to John MacArthur. If he stops short, ever so slightly, from _going all the way back,_ his salvation is real even though he is in those vile sins! That is not holiness! Here is the listing of sins that John MacArthur commented on:

> Or do you not know that **the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived;** neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God. (1 Cor. 6:9-11, NASB)

The **[Sovereign God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sovereignty-of-god.html)** who perfectly understands _grace_ disagrees with John MacArthur. Rev. 21:8 is a clear passage which God spoke from His throne about who will NOT enter His kingdom. The Apostle Paul, the real grace teacher, gives us other Holy Spirit inspired lists in 1 Cor. 6:9,10; Eph. 5:5-7; Gal. 5:19-21; etc. Who will YOU believe? Also, please note: John MacArthur, known for "Lordship" theology, teaches the same as **[Charles Stanley](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/stanlysc.html)** and **[Charles Ryrie](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ryrie.htm)** on the believer's security!



> **But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars -- their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death**(Rev. 21:8).
> 
> For of this you can be **SURE: No immoral, impure or greedy person -- such a man is an idolater -- has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God's wrath comes on those who are disobedient** (Eph. 5:5,6).
>

> The acts of the **[sinful nature](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sinful-nature.htm)** are obvious: **sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God** (Gal. 5:19-21).



## <a name="john%20macarthur"></a>John MacArthur To The _Adulterously_ Married

Under the suheading of **[_Those That Are Illegitimately Divorced and Remarried_ John MacArthur](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/john-macarthur-adulterous-marriage/)** teaches the obscene:

> Now, there is only one other category. Some of you are saying, "I have a problem. I fouled up my marriage when I was a Christian and got a divorce that wasn't legitimate. Furthermore, I am an adulterer (or an adulteress), because I remarried when I had no grounds. What is my status?" Well, you're a **[sinner](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christiansinner.htm) - welcome to the club.** If you've already violated God's laws as a Christian and **you were illegitimately [divorced and remarried](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/divorce.html) (in other words, you're in a union that the Bible defines as an adulterous union)**, you have only one recourse - to confess the sin, tell God the sorrow of your heart, and **stay in that same union** ... (John MacArthur, Jr., _On Divorce,_ Moody Press Edition, 1985, Chicago, p. 98, emphasis mine)

That is clear proof that John MacArthur is saying they would be _**[lifestyle practicing adulterers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/practice-sin.htm)**_, which he denies is possible at other times. Furthermore, he doesn't say such _lifestyle practicing adulterous people_ were false converts, but consoles them by welcoming them into the _club of sinners!_ Moreover, he tells such adulterers to just tell God they are sorry and confess their _adultery!_ According to John MacArthur, no turning away from their adultery (repentance) is needed for their forgiveness. John MacArthur's teaching, therefore, is a poison-filled wicked abomination. BTW, the mere fact that John MacArthur denies **[King David lost his salvation when in adultery and murder](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html)** should be enough to prove John MacArthur has a skewed understanding of Scripture.

## [A Testimony of Repentance From Remarriage Adultery](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance-from-remarriage-adultery.html)

WARNING! Dear reader, for your soul's sake avoid John MacArthur's Calvinistic version of _saving faith._ It is NOT the message of the Bible! John MacArthur needs to take to heart the compelling evidence found in **[The Believer's Conditional Security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelical-books.html)**, repent of his dangerous false teachings, and openly renounce his Calvinistic doctrines! **[Eternal Security is not true](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**.
