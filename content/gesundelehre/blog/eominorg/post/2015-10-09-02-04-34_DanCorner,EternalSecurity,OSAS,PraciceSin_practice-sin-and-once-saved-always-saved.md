## The _Practice Sin_ Diversion

**Does one have to _practice sin_ to reveal his lost condition or show he was [never saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm), as some teach? Eternal security proponents often miss the clarity of Rev. 21:8, but perhaps this is what they want to do, for the sake of their own sin doctrine. The context of that Scripture is powerfully clear. One doesn't have to _practice sin_ to be deserving of the lake of fire:**

[![practice sin](../../files/pictures/man-in-hell-because-of-eternal-security.jpg "I thought occasional sins were okay and only practice sin would condemn to hell. I'm here because of false teaching.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternaltorment.html)

> But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars - **their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur.** This is the second death.

## The Golden Calf Incident Absolutely Was Not _Practice Sin_

[![practice sin](../../files/pictures/holy-life-impure-reject-God.jpg "GOSPEL preaching is not compatible with this practice sin LIE.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/holiness-preaching.html)

Then we have 1 Cor. 10:7 which proves that Paul's grace message declared that **a true Christian could become an _idolater,_** the same Greek word as found in Rev. 21:8\. Hence, the Lord's apostles taught a person once saved could go to the lake of fire by committing this sin, since those cited in Rev. 21:8 go to the lake of fire. This alone refutes the license for immorality called _[**eternal security**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)._ (End of debate.)

Moreover, the 1 Cor. 10:7 passage refers back to the Golden Calf incident (cf. Ex. 32), and proves that **_idolatry_ doesn't have to be habitual _lifestyle_ or practice of sin to make the Corinthian Christians _idolaters_!** Again, since 1 Cor. 10:7 refers back to just **one act**, apparently **Paul believed that just _one act_ would change the Corinthian Christian into _idolaters_!**

![golden calf was not practice sin willfully](../../files/pictures/golden-calf.jpg "The golden calf incident was not practice sin.")

The above truth is very similar to the fact that **it only takes one act of murder or adultery (not many) to be a Bible-defined _murderer_ or _adulterer_,** according to Scripture. **It doesn't have to be _practice of sin:_**

> If a man strikes someone with an iron object so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death. Or if anyone has a stone in his hand that could kill, and he strikes someone so that he dies, **he is a murderer**; the murderer shall be put to death. Or if anyone has a wooden object in his hand that could kill, and he hits someone so that he dies, he is a murderer; the murderer shall be put to death. (Num 35:16-18)

> If a man commits adultery with another man's wife - with the wife of his neighbor - both **the adulterer and the adulteress** must be put to death. (Lev 20:10)

To say that a Christian can commit adultery and not be an _adulterer_ as mentioned in 1 Cor. 6:9,10 is **to teach both a deadly lie and a license for immorality at the same time. That is true even though one does reject once saved always saved! Note: it only takes one act of murder or adultery to be a bible-defined _murderer_ or _adulterer_, according to scripture.** It does not have to be habitual acts or _lifestyle_, as **[HERETIC David Servert](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/david_servant_great_gospel_deception.htm)** teaches. That truth is also a death blow to the sin gospel, for it **shows King David died spiritually, before he repented.** King David committed one act of adultery and murder and therefore was both an _adulterer and murderer_, according to Scripture. Even though false teachers hate this fact of Scripture, it proves that **David lost his salvation for a time, before he regained it!** (See pages 366-369 in _[**The Believer's Conditional Security**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dan-corner-the-believers-conditional-security.html)_ for a further explanation about David losing his salvation.)

At this point the die-hard eternal security advocates try to somehow distort these truths or cloud this issue for the sake of their doctrine which implies that all believers can turn to the wickedness of adultery and murder, like David, and remain saved, since it wasn't _lifestyle._ It should be apparent at this point why eternal security is a license for immorality taught under the false banner of _grace_ (Jude 3,4) and **one of the greatest threats to holy living.** (NOTE: Calvinism claims the 5 points of Calvinism are _the **[doctrines of grace](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html)**!_)

The Calvinist argument of _lifestyle_ has deceived some, but not those who have pondered the above Biblical truths. Furthermore, **Paul, who wrote Gal. 5:19-21, apparently believed the Christians in the region of Galatia could sin habitually, and therefore, not inherit the kingdom of God!** Paul knew a true believer could turn away and never return. This truth is exemplified by **King Saul in the Old Testament, who totally and finally fell away from the faith as well as [King Solomon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/solomons-apostasy.html).** We must understand 1 John 3:9 and Mt. 7:23 with these facts and other such Scriptures in mind. Remember, Paul's gospel of grace and what it taught about the believer's security:

## <a name="practice%20sin"></a>_Practice Sinning_ and The Gospel Are Opposites

> By this gospel you are saved, **if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.** (1 Cor 15:2)

> But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation - **if you continue in your faith**, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant. (Col 1:22,23)

> You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in." Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and you stand by faith. **Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either**. Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, **provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.** And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again. (Rom 11:19-23)

> **Do you not know that the [unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/will-not-inherit-the-kingdom-of-God.htm)? Do not be deceived; neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor [drunkards](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-kept-me-safe-as-an-occasional-drunkard.htm), nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Cor. 6:9,10, NASB)**

**Again: one does not have to commit _lifestyle_ sin or _practice sin_ to be indicted by Rev. 21:8. [One sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lose-salvation.html) can cause loss of salvation. [King David](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html) proves the righteous can turn to evil and die spiritually for it, without practicing sin. Hence, any true believer can also lose his salvation by one act of adultery or murder. Do not be deceived, one doesn't have to _practice sin_ to bring on [spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)!**
