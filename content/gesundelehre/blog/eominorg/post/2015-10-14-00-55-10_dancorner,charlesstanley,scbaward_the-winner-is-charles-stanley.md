## More Charles Stanley Errors!

**Charles Stanley, an [eternal security teacher](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html), wins the _Skull And Crossbones Award_ for changing the grace of God into a "license for immorality" (Jude 4) with the following statement:**

![Charles Stanley Gets The Skull And Crossbones Award](../../files/pictures/snc.jpg)

> "And so, sometimes out of ignorance or whatever it might be, they attempt to gratify and meet those needs the same way they did before they were saved, and therefore, **you can't tell a carnal believer from a lost man**. That is, you can't tell the cold from the carnal because the truth is, **they're both acting the same way.** Now, one of them is in Christ and one of them isn't. One of them is lost and the other one is in Christ. One of them knows about God and knows him in the experience of salvation; the other doesn't know him at all" [Spiritual Vs. Carnal--Study in 1 Cor., Tape #8, PQ092].

To contrast the teaching of **[Charles Stanley](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-stanley.html)** with Scripture, see 1 Cor. 6:9,10; 1 Jn. 3:7-10; Rev. 21:8; etc.

> Do you not know that **the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived;** neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers, will inherit the kingdom of God. Such were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God (1 Cor. 6:9,10, NASB).

> "Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. He who does what is sinful is of the devil, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the devil's work. No one who is born of God will continue to sin, because God's seed remains in him; he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born of God. **This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are**: Anyone who does not do what is right is not a child of God; nor is anyone who does not love his brother" (1 Jn. 3:7-10).

> "But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars -- their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death" (Rev. 21:8).

Charles Stanley's distorted view of a **[Christian](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html)** through his carnal Christian teachings are not unique to him. **[Dave Hunt](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/carnal-christian-dave-hunt.htm)**, and others, similarly teach the same horrible way!

**[The Gospel According To Charles Stanley](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-stanley.html) is an important read to get the sad details about what Charles Stanley teaches and how he misunderstands the [Word of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wordgod.html). It is loaded with information and documented. Far beyond that booklet is the massive 801 page book, [The Believer's Conditional Security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dan-corner-the-believers-conditional-security.html). It is the most complete book refuting [once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) ever written.**
