## Bible Truth About _The Mark Of The Beast_

As technology continues to advance and we persist in hearing of wars and rumors of wars (Mt. 24:6), certainly many will **wrongly think the infamous _mark of the beast_ is now present before it actually comes into existence.** Such a view has also led to an unfounded _antichrist conspiracy_. The truth is, as of June 2014, neither the antichrist, nor the mark of the beast are here, even though the [**mark of the beast technology**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/markbeast.html) may be for the latter. **As you can be assured that one day the antichrist will be in global control, you can be equally certain that the mark of the beast will be issued on a worldwide scale at that same time.** For this to occur there will be a one world organization led by the antichrist himself.

**[[Do This To Gain Victory Over The Mark Of The Beast](#markofthebeast)]**

Furthermore, the mark of the beast is a mark which refers to the antichrist, who is called _the beast_ in Revelation. In fact, to be more precise, it is the number or name of this vile person.

According to Scripture, **no one will get this mark by _accident_ and no one has it now. It will _not_ be like Tim LaHaye’s poisonous myth about the pre-trib rapture, which has done great harm**. Rev. 13:15-18 reads:

> He [the false prophet] was given power to give breath to the image of the first beast, so that it could speak and cause all who refused to worship the image to be killed. He also forced everyone, small and great, rich and poor, free and slave, to receive **a mark on his right hand or on his forehead, so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark, which is the name of the beast or the number of his name.** This calls for wisdom. If anyone has insight, let him calculate the number of the beast, for it is man’s number. His number is 666.



## Details Associated With _The Mark Of The Beast_

Notice the following four details surrounding the issuing of the mark of the beast, from the above passage:

● There will be a speaking image, or statue, of the antichrist (or beast).  
● People will be under heavy pressure to _worship_ that same image of the antichrist. In fact, it will be a life or death issue. To stay alive at that future point you must commit _idolatry_ with his image. **To refuse to worship it will mean physical death.**  
● The mark of the beast will be **on the right hand or forehead of the recipients.**  
● The worldwide society will be such that **unless you receive the _mark of the beast_ you will not be able to buy or sell anything.**

## _The Mark Of The Beast_ is NOT Out Now

**In light of those truths, it is impossible for the mark of the beast to be out _now_,** even though some think otherwise. Here is an actual email about this and the _bio chip:_

> I would like to hear more about the end times and the mark of the beast. **I believe that the bio chip that we are hearing about at this time is the mark of the beast. What happens if someone receives the bio chip and finds out he has taken the mark?**

A number of years ago a person wrote in and expressed his view that he thought the _social security number_ is the mark of the beast. Others think it is a _National ID:_

> I read your article on the mark of the beast. What do you think about the Real ID Act and HR418? Have you heard about it? I just now found out and I am deeply concerned to the point of where I will soon be finding myself making a decision. My spirit within me says “NO” to all this. Please do a Google search on it ... you will be surprised, many [do] not know but this is all about a **National ID** that was passed and hidden in a war bill.

Sadly, people believe like that because they are not reading and/or believing the Biblical message. Finally, please remember this: If you receive the mark of the beast **you will be_ tormented with burning sulfur_** (Rev. 14:9-12):

> A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: “If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand, he, too, will drink of the wine of God’s fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name.” **This calls for patient endurance on the part of the saints who obey God’s commandments and remain faithful to Jesus.**

Hence, that applies to _Christians._ **Christians will NOT be raptured out of here before the antichrist comes to reign** and **there is no [eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html). Do not be deceived by Tim LaHaye, [Dave Hunt](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/davehuntsc.html), [Jack Van Impe](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/vanimpe.html) or anyone else, including [Hal Lindsey](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hal-lindsey.html). To receive the mark of the beast means you will not enter God's kingdom after death.**



## <a name="markofthebeast"></a>This Is How YOU Will Get Victory Over _The Mark Of The Beast_

**You must _not_ take the mark of the beast, even if you have to die, which will happen sooner or later anyway.** Victory over the antichrist and his mark is spelled out in **Rev. 12:11\. Memorize the following verse and act upon it!**

> They overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony; **they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death.**

**Regardless what happens do NOT take _the mark of the beast_.**
