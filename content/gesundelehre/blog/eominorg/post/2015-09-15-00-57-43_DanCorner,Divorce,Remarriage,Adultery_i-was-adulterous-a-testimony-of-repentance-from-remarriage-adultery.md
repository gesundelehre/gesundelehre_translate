## How I Found Out About My Remarriage Adultery

[![divorce remarriage adultery](../../files/pictures/divorce-remarriage-adultery.jpg "divorce remarriage adultery")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/divorce.html)

It was around the middle of June 2013, when I stumbled across an article about _remarriage adultery_ where I read,

> By law, a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive; but if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage. So then, **if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an adulteress** (Romans 7:2-3).

Soon after came another verse -- equally terrifying:

> **Or do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived:** neither fornicators, nor idolaters, **nor adulterers,** nor effeminate, nor homosexuals, nor thieves, nor the covetous, nor drunkards, nor slanderers, nor swindlers **will inherit the kingdom of God** (1 Cor. 6:9-10).

## I Felt Sick To My Stomach

**I felt sick to my stomach and my heart started pounding as I realized the relationship I had been in for the past 6 years was NOT a true marriage after all, but _adultery,_ that is, _remarriage adultery_, and that God viewed me as _wicked_. I was in the gravest of dangers because if I died at that moment, I would spend an eternity in hell for _remarriage adultery._** Reactions were quick and intense by family members, friends and other professing Christians. They figured I had some other reason why I was doing what they considered a "crazy thing" other than the fact that the Bible calls it _adultery,_ and God commands us not just to confess our sins, but also to obey Him and forsake them in order to be forgiven.

> **[He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/believing.html)**; but **he that obeyeth not shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him** (John 3:36).

(See also: Prov. 28:13; 2 Chron.7:14, Jonah 3:5-10, Dan 4:27, Ezekial 18:21-23, Ezek.27-31, 1 Sam 15:22, etc.).

> Some Pharisees came and tested him (Jesus) by asking, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?" "What did Moses command you?" he replied. They said, "Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away." "It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law," Jesus replied. "But at the beginning of creation God ‘made them male and female.’ For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh. So they are no longer two, but one flesh. **Therefore what God has joined together, let no one separate." When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. He answered, "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery"** (Mark 10:2-12).



## Deuteronomy 24

The Lord Jesus repeats this commandment again in Lk. 14:16\. **Both times, Jesus effectively overturned Deuteronomy 24.** Nonetheless, those looking for loopholes still try to use Deut 24 to try and justify committing remarriage adultery. It is interesting to note that it was the Pharisees, the self-indulgent religious leaders back then, who were also pro **[divorce and remarriage](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/divorce.html)** - just like today.



## The Fornication Exception

Note: This fornication exception cannot be used to justify _remarriage adultery_, but can only be applied to the ancient Jewish practice of betrothal (like engagement but legally binding). If a man found out his bride was not a virgin, he could divorce her. We, the Gentiles, do not have betrothal; thus, **there is no fornication (sexual immorality) exception in the rest of the New Testament. In other words, today your spouse’s cheating does not permit you to divorce and remarry.**



## Think Joseph and Mary

When Mary had come back from her cousin's house obviously with child, Joseph thought she had been sexually immoral and he wanted to quietly divorce her (to spare her from being stoned to death under the OT law), but an angel of the Lord told him not to put Mary away (divorce her) because she had been faithful and had conceived through the Holy Spirit. **Because this sexual immorality exception only applies to ancient Jewish betrothal customs, it is only found in Matthew. Furthermore, abandonment and abuse do not justify remarriage either; a party can leave and stay away for safety (we are not called to bondage); however, remarriage is not allowed.**

We are in a worldwide apostasy right now. Most "churches" are really apostasy traps. I had to get out of there and get away from them in order to find the truth. We had even received "biblical" counseling in the past from the church elders to help us biblically parent and stepparent our "blended family". The elders and pastor knew our situation, but **instead of warning us that we were on the road to hell for remarriage adultery, they told me that I did not understand grace and forgiveness!**

> For the lips of a priest ought to preserve knowledge, because he is the messenger of the Lord Almighty and people seek instruction from his mouth. **But you have turned from the way and by your teaching have caused many to stumble;** (Malachi 2:7-8).

Don’t believe those "shepherds who feed only themselves" (Jude 12). "Those who, through smooth talk and flattery deceive the minds of naïve people" (Rom. 16:18) "Keep away from them, for they are not serving our Lord Jesus, but their own appetites." (Rom. 16:17). **John the Baptist was beheaded for pointing these truths out about remarriage adultery.** (Mk 6:19, Lk. 3:19, Mt 14:3)

## Herodias Was In Remarriage Adultery

Please consider the following passage concerning _remarriage adultery_ from Mk. 6:17, 18:

> "For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. **He did this because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had married. For John had been saying to Herod, 'It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.**'"

**Even though Herod had "married" Herodias, she was still considered "Philip's wife." That is why John said it was not lawful for him to have his brother's wife. In other words, remarriage adultery was being committed by both Herodias and Herod. Although Herod and Herodias were not Christians, God’s law still applied to them regardless of whether or not they believed it or agreed with it.** That is apparent from what John the Baptist said. (Every knee will bow to the Lord Jesus who is Truth and the Word of God in the flesh.)

> To the married I give this command (not I, but the Lord): **A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she does, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. And a husband must not divorce his wife** (1 Cor. 7:10-11).

> A woman is bound to her husband **as long as he lives.** (1 Cor. 7:39)

> Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; **Adultery,** fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which **I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.** (Galatians 5:19-21)

> But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the **sexually immoral**, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars - **their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur.** This is the second death. Revelation 21:8

> And I will come near to you to judgment; and **I will be a swift witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers** (Malachi 3:5).



## My "Christian" Life Had Been In Vain

**I was horrified upon my discovery that my "Christian" life had all been in vain. How could I have been so deceived! The whole time I was there, singing songs to Jesus, handing out gospel tracts, sponsoring Compassion kids, and giving my tithing dollars to those smiley religious fable and fairy tale tellers. I was on the road to hell being told lies that my [future sins](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/futuresins.html) were forgiven before I committed them, that [all God could see when looking down at me was Christ’s righteousness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/esimputedrighteousness.html), and how much the Lord delighted in me (no matter what wickedness I did.)**

> **The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD** (Proverbs 15:8).

**For years, even though I did many religious works in Jesus’ name and although I called Jesus Lord, I was one of those continuous evildoers (my everyday remarriage adultery) referred to in Mt 7:22-23.**

> Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. **Away from me, you evildoers!'**

> **You have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet you say, "How have we wearied Him?" In that you say, "Everyone who does evil is good in the sight of the LORD, and He delights in them,"** or, "Where is the God of justice"? (Malachi 2:13-17).



## NO Christian Adulterers

There is no such thing as a Christian adulterer on the road to heaven. (Also, **[lusting is adultery](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lust.html)** (Matthew ch 5) and causing others to lust will bring one under condemnation as well.

> The Son of Man will send out his angels, and **they will weed out of his kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil. They will throw them into the blazing furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.** (Mt 13:41-42).



## I Was Determined To Obey The Lord At Any Cost

But I decided that I was not going to listen to men and devils and their fine sounding arguments. **I was determined to obey the Lord at any cost. I vacated my adulterous remarriage. I am completely severed from my old life.**

> For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me (Jesus) and for the gospel will save it. **What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?** Or what can anyone give in exchange for their soul? If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of them when he comes in his Father’s glory with the holy angels. (Mk. 8:35-38).

The Lord Jesus repeats this salvation warning 6 times. (Mt. 10:37-39, Mt.16:25, Lk. 9:24, Lk.17:33, Jn 12:25) **For the time will come when people will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires (lusts), they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear (2 Tim 4:3). What could be more appealing to the lusts and desires of the flesh than to be told by the big name preachers that, under grace, "fornication is permissible" as well as remarriage after divorce? (which is really _remarriage adultery)._**

> For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person - such a person is an idolater - has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient. (Ephesians 5:5-6)

**Today's popular preachers are saying empty words when they are telling people that they may remarry after divorce or that their _remarriage adultery_ is merely a one-time sin that can be confessed but still continued in and ongoing under _grace._**

I heard some frightening statistics; as many as 40-60% of people sitting in the pews are in remarriage adultery and other relationships diametrically opposed to God's word. In the "Bible Belt", the divorce rate is about 50% higher than the rest of the country - most likely the poisonous fruit of the poisonous tree of "**[once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesus-es.html)**", "**[eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**," or the "perseverance or preservation of the saints" (all names of the same poisonous doctrine that leads people to believe the Devil’s lie, "Ye shall not surely die." (Gen. 3:4) Satan was the first eternal security teacher and is surely behind _remarriage adultery._ I don’t want to be in conscious torment 400 quadrillion years from now because it was too hard or inconvenient to leave a comfortable situation. **Our soul is our most precious possession, and no person or sin is worth going to hell over. The narrow road that leads to eternal life is difficult and often lonely (Lk. 13:24, Mt. 7:14) but, _we are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes_** (James 4:14). "All people are like grass, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall" (1 Pet.1:24).



## I Vacated My _Adulterous Remarriage_

I am still overcoming the shock and awe of all this, but **better to be shocked now, than to be shocked upon physical death, expecting an entrance into the Lord’s presence, only to wake up in flames of torment realizing that I have been deceived and _adulterous._** _Love does not delight in evil, but rejoices with the truth_ (1 Cor 13:6). Our life here on earth is a _test_ --a betrothal period. **If we want to attend the marriage supper of the Lamb, we must be a faithful bride until the very end in order to not be put away by the Bridegroom whose name is Jealous. To be adulterous through a remarriage, that is, a _remarriage adultery_ will prevent that. Christ is coming back for a faithful bride, without spot, wrinkle or blemish-- wise virgins who have kept their lamps burning and ready for service-- not a bunch of people committing _remarriage adultery_ who go inside a church building. God bless you.**
