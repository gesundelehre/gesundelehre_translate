I have never felt the need to contact any forum/web site before ... It is just the best feeling in the world to have read your notes on [**once saved always saved**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html). I feel amazed that we are not alone in our beliefs as I was told to go back to Scripture as I clearly did not understand them. I was also told that my views were heretical and dangerous for believing in the doctrine of [**lost salvation**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/can_salvation_be_lost_osas.html)....I haven't been to church for three weeks. People started to look at myself and my family as freaks. We were told to stop asking questions. I am so utterly grateful to your site for giving me strength. I have no idea where we will go now. I thought all [**evangelical**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/index.html) preachers preached the same message but you have given us hope again. We are desperate to be among Christian brothers and sisters and to be [**baptized**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/baptism.html). We will continue on the road. God bless.
