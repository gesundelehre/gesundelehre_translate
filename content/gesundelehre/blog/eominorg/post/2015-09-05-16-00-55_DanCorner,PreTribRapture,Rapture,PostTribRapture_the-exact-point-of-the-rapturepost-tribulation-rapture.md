## Five Scriptures Proving The _Post Tribulation Rapture_

[![post tribulation rapture post trib](../../files/pictures/overcame-by-blood-of-Lamb.jpg "The Bible teaches a post tribulation rapture")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/are-you-ready-for-the-rapture.htm)

**When will the [rapture](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/are-you-ready-for-the-rapture.htm) occur? Will it be before, during or after the great tribulation? Five Scriptures are very clear regarding the _exact_ timing of the rapture. If you drop all preconceived ideas and just go by the Scriptures themselves you will see the clarity of it all. Let’s look at the evidence, which sadly supports the _post tribulation rapture_ doctrine.**

<big>**[VITAL Scriptures To Know During The Reign Of Antichrist](#post%20tribulation%20rapture)**</big>



## Mark 13:24-27 Shows A _Post Tribulation Rapture_

[![post trib rapture](../../files/pictures/post-tribulation-rapture.jpg "post trib rapture")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/are-you-ready-for-the-rapture.htm)

> 1.   And he will send his **[angels](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/angels.html)** and gather his elect from the four winds, **from** the ends of the **earth to the ends of the heavens** (Mark 13:27).

NOTE: This event is the rapture. The elect will be gathered from earth to heaven and it occurs **_post_ tribulation** (or _that distress_ depending on the translation referred to), according to Mark 13:24-27:

> But in those days, **following that distress,** the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from the sky, and the heavenly bodies will be shaken. At that time men will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. And he will send his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of the heavens.

The second passage is very well-known, but apparently little understood:

<big>**[FIND OUT When The Mark Of The Beast Will Be Issued Related To The Rapture](#post%20trib%20rapture)**</big>



## The Last Trumpet _Mystery_

> 2.   Listen, I tell you **a mystery:** We will not all sleep, but we will all be changed—in a flash, in the twinkling of an eye, **at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed** (1 Cor. 15:51,52).

NOTE: The rapture is when our bodies will be changed and will occur when **the last trumpet** is sounded. This event is a also called a “mystery.”



## _Our Being Gathered To Him_

> 3.   Concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and **our being gathered to him,** we ask you, brothers, not to become easily unsettled or alarmed by some prophecy, report or letter supposed to have come from us, saying that the day of the Lord has already come. Don’t let anyone deceive you in any way, for **that day will not come until** the rebellion occurs and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the man doomed to destruction (2 Thess. 2:1-3).

NOTE: This teaching is clearly about the rapture for it is described here as “our being gathered to him.” The two major events cited by Paul, which must precede it, have not happened and cannot happen until sometime after the temple is rebuilt and the [**antichrist**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/antichrist.html) is then revealed. Hence, **the antichrist will be revealed before the rapture and the saints will face him.**



## The Seventh Trumpet = The Last Trumpet

> 4a. The **seventh** angel sounded his **trumpet**, and there were loud voices in heaven, which said: “**The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ**, and he will reign for ever and ever.” And the twenty-four elders, who were seated on their thrones before God, fell on their faces and worshiped God, saying: “We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, the One who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to reign. The nations were angry; and **your wrath has come.** The time has come for judging the dead, and **for rewarding your servants the prophets and your saints and those who reverence your name, both small and great**—and for destroying those who destroy the earth” (Rev. 11:15-18).

NOTE: **The seventh trumpet is the _last trumpet_.** This is also when **God’s wrath begins** and **the saints are _rewarded_.** Lk. 14:14 says the rewards will be given out at the resurrection of the **[righteous](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/righteous.html)** (or rapture). 

Immediately before the seventh trumpet sounds, we read this about the seventh trumpet:

> 4b. But in the days when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, **the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he announced to his servants the prophets** (Rev. 10:7).

NOTE: The rapture event is a “mystery” in 1 Cor. 15:51,52 and here in Rev. 10:7 (at the _last trumpet—_the seventh one). This means all that is described during the first six trumpets will be experienced by the last generation of **[Christians](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html)**.


<a name="post%20trib%20rapture"></a>
## Before The _First Resurrection_ (The Post Tribulation Rapture) The Mark Of The Beast Will Be Enforced

> 5.  I saw thrones on which were seated those who had been given authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been **beheaded because of their testimony for Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image and had not received his mark on their foreheads or their hands**. They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years. (The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.) **This is the first resurrection**. Blessed and holy are those who have part in **the first resurrection.** The second death has no power over them, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4-6).

NOTE: **The first resurrection (or rapture) will occur after Christians are beheaded for remaining faithful during the time of the antichrist, which includes not taking the [mark of the beast](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/markbeast.html)**. Compare to 2 Thess. 2:1-3\. Just like the pieces of a puzzle that fit together and form a clear picture, when these **[Scriptures](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)** are compared it becomes crystal clear that **the rapture will occur after the tribulation period and we face the antichrist.**

Also related to Rev. 20:4-6 is this passage:

> If anyone is to go into captivity, into captivity he will go. **If anyone is to be killed with the sword, with the sword he will be killed. <u>This calls for patient endurance and faithfulness on the part of the saints.</u>** (Rev 13:10)

Again, this is more evidence that the saints will face the antichrist and this will be before the first resurrection (or rapture). Yes, there will be a rapture (a catching up), as the Bible teaches:

> For the Lord himself will come down from heaven, with a loud command, with the voice of the archangel and with the **trumpet call** of **[God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.html)**, and the dead in Christ will rise first. After that, we who are still alive and are left will be **caught up** together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever (1 Thess. 4:16,17).

But before that event the Book of Revelation teaches an all-out nuclear exchange with massive devastation and death. Again, such will occur before the rapture, unlike what the any-moment rapture people think and have been told. Certainly, Tim LaHaye’s “Left Behind” series and many other such videos, books, etc. have done much harm regarding instilling false hopes in God’s children regarding the rapture escape. **The Bible teaches a _post tribulation rapture._ It is as it is.**

**One can only wonder how many will have their faith destroyed, if they survive the all-out nuclear exchange with billions dying. Will their faith in the Bible and Jesus be destroyed because they were taught they would be taken away before such happens? If so, then perhaps, their _falling away_ will be part of the great apostasy mentioned in 2 Thess. 2:3.**

Dear saint, in the past the children of God have been burned at the stake, ripped apart by wild animals for amusement, beaten to death, etc. Please don’t think you won’t go through similar rough times yourself because you are his child. Don’t be deceived.

## Two Of The Most Important Scriptures For That Time

As the age comes to the close, with wickedness increasing and love growing cold (Mt. 24:12), please remember these two Scriptures:

> **Do not be afraid of those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.** Rather, **be afraid of the One who can destroy both soul and body in hell** (Matt. 10:28).

> They overcame him by the **[blood of the Lamb](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesusblood.html)** and by **<u>the word of their testimony; they did not love their lives so much as to shrink from death</u>** (Rev. 12:11).

Remember also that the tribulation is not the wrath of God, as you might have been taught. Furthermore, the tribulation is not seven years in length.

[![Rapture False Prophecy](../../files/pictures/rapture1992.jpg)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/harold_camping.htm)

**It is amazing how some pre-trib rapture people are so adamant about their belief in the timing of the rapture as to state that one is a _heretic_ and/or _unsaved_ if he rejects the pre-trib rapture teaching, but this has actually been taught and some have believed this very thing. May God help them to see the truth. BTW, there have been MANY false prophecies which have come from the pre-trib rapture camp. Just two such people were [Harold Camping](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/harold_camping.htm) and [Edgar Whisenant](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/EdgarWhisenant.htm).**

**Remember this: A wonderful paradise kingdom is awaiting the _overcomer_ who remains faithful to God, even if he has the privilege to die for Jesus before getting there. Ponder Rev. 21:4 and 1 Cor. 2:9 for details. Also, there is NO [once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesus-es.html)**. We have a two-tape series (code 119) available on this subject teaching a post tribulation rapture which can be ordered from our [**catalog**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sctapes.html) page if anyone is interested.
