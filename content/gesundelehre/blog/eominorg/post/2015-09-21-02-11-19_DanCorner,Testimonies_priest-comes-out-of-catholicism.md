# Priest Comes Out Of Catholicism

... Brethren, the Lord is so wonderful. He has called me out of Roman Catholicism. I was a Roman priest for a length of time. I believe now I am a **[new creature](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/new-creation.html)** as I have left this false doctrine. I would rather be poor, miss my keyboards, miss my photocopy machine, miss my computer, miss my vehicle and good food but gain everlasting life. I came out with some new believers. We are looking for a faithful fellowship to support us spiritually. Many of my people are **[Roman Catholic](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html)** believers. Jesus is my personal savior. His precious blood has cleansed all my sins. Please can you send us materials to reach more lost souls? I anticipate hearing from you brethren. (Malawi, Central Africa)
