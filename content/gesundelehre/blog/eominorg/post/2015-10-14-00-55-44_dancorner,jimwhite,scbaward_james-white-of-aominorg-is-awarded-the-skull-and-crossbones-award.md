**James White of AOMin.Org changes the grace of God into a "license to sin" (Jude 4) with the following statement:**

> "One **must** believe in the **[perseverance of the saints](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/perseverance-of-the-saints.htm)** if one is to **accurately present the gospel of grace**. To do anything else is to **edit the gospel**" (Mr. James White, Alpha and Omega Ministries, personal E-mail dated 8/30/97).

![Skull and Crossbones for James White aomin.org](../../files/pictures/snc.jpg)

For AOMin.org's director James White to link the perseverance of the saints (which is the same as once saved always saved) to the gospel of grace shows how extreme some people can be about this issue. Unfortuately, James White and AOMin.org are not alone! There are others who elevate that heresy to the _gospel, Christianity,_ etc. and thereby reveal that **eternal security is [another gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html)**. On the contrary, the Biblical gospel of grace is clearly a _conditional_ one:

> **By this gospel you are saved, IF YOU HOLD FIRMLY** to the word I preached to you. **Otherwise, you have believed in vain** (1 Cor. 15:2).

> But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation -- **IF YOU CONTINUE** in your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. **This is the gospel** that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant (Col. 1:22, 23).

Why has the clear truth about a _conditional_ security for the believer in Christ been omitted from today's gospel? It's because we are suffering under a heavy Calvinistic influence. Hence, a **[counterfeit gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/whichgospel.htm)**, taught by different grace changers, is spread to the detriment of souls. The proponents of such say they themselves are sinners, see no need to live holy for salvation and have gone so far as to smear the Apostle Paul as the **[worst of sinners](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/worst-of-sinners.htm)**! AOMin.org is part of this worldwide problem. That means James White certainly is not as sound as some might think and has stumbled many by teaching [**Calvinism**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html). The truth is, what Mr. James White thinks is **the gospel of grace** is really a _license for immorality_, which Christians are to contend _against_ (Jude 3,4). In accordance with that Scripture, Mr. James R White, again [in 2011] I (Dan Corner) challenge you to an equally-timed, fair, public debate on the subject of my book, which is [**The Believer's Conditional Security**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dan-corner-the-believers-conditional-security.html).

**The most exhaustive refutation**

**security ever written.**

Email sent to Mr. James White from Pastor C. H. on 4/5/2001:

Hi Mr. White,

![James White of AOmin.org](../../files/pictures/jameswhite.jpg)

I read over your exchange with Dan Corner. First, it is interesting to hear that you believe Calvinism is the basis of OSAS since I have met many Calvinist who completely disagree. Secondly, it appears that you are avoiding a debate with him and are attempting to divert any debate that might proceed into a debate on the issues that you believe are foundational for OSAS. You must realize that to shift the focus from the main issue to what you consider foundational issues is to sever those issues and leave the main topic high and dry. In any case, I do not see how a debate on OSAS could avoid discussing your Calvinistic points.

In my opinion, you should be aware of the fact that a debate on OSS cannot avoid touching the points of Calvinism. That leaves me to wonder why you set the counter parameters for a different debate, i.e., to discuss points of Calvinism rather than the whole topic of OSAS. The only conclusion is because the true error of OSAS would be obscured in verbiage that detracts, rather than highlights, the primary issue.

That issue is the overwhelming evidence that OSAS, and Calvinism, produces some of the most hypocritical and apostate individuals I have ever personally encountered. That is not to say that everyone in these particular genres are likewise ... However, millions who believe that they are saved because of these doctrines are in fact headed for eternity in hell. OSAS in particular is gleaning a harvest for eternal darkness.

Honestly speaking, I believe you have not dealt fairly and honestly with Mr. Corner. I read your book on KJV Onlyism and applaud your efforts. Would you avoid a debate with Gail Riplinger? I don't think so. Neither should you avoid debating Mr. Corner. There are many individuals who would like to hear an ethical and cordial debate on this topic. So far, I have not heard of one and the general feeling is that OSAS proponents haven't a scriptural foundation. May you reconsider your rejection of the OSAS debate.

In Christ,
 C. H.
