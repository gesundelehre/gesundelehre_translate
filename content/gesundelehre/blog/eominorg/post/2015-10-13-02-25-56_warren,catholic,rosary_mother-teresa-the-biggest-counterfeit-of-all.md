## Counterfeit Christianity

The Lord Jesus Christ when questioned about the sign of His coming and the end of the age, said, "Take heed that no one deceives you" (Mt. 24:5). The Apostle Paul instructed us, "Now the spirit speaketh expressly, that in latter times some shall depart from the faith, giving heed to **[seducing spirits](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/religious-deception.html)**, and doctrines of devils ..." (1 Tim. 4:1).

[![mother teresa counterfeit christian](../../files/pictures/counterfeit-christianity.jpg "Religious deception is rampant and exalting Mother Teresa as a Christian is to be part of it!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html)

A clear example of deception is the act of counterfeiting. When we present American currency at a bank in Mexico to exchange for pesos, the bank personnel are extremely cautious, examining carefully each bill to insure it is not counterfeit. They do not want to be deceived.

It is clear that there cannot be counterfeiting apart from a counterfeiter. There cannot be deception apart from a deceiver and therefore there cannot be counterfeit Christianity apart from a counterfeit Christian.

One of the clearest examples of a counterfeit Christian on today's scene, in my opinion, is **[Mother Teresa](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/motherteresasc.html)**. In her book, Life In The Spirit: Reflections, Meditations, and Prayers, she says on pages 81 and 82:

> "We never try to convert those who receive (aid) to Christianity but in our work we bear witness to the love of God's presence and if **[Catholics](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html)**, Protestants, Buddhists, or agnostics become for this better men - simply better - we will be satisfied. It matters to the individual what church he belongs to. If that individual thinks and believes that this is the only way to God for her or him, this is the way God comes into their life - his life. If he does not know any other way and if he has no doubt so that he does not need to search then this is his way to **[salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)**."

Jesus Christ clearly stated, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. NO ONE COMES TO THE FATHER EXCEPT THROUGH ME" (Jn. 14:6).

The Mexican bank tellers are trained to recognize counterfeit $100.00 bills by a thorough understanding and knowledge of the real ones. When they have this awareness, they can quickly spot a counterfeit.

It doesn't take much study or understanding of the gospel to recognize that what Mother Teresa preaches is not the doctrine of Jesus Christ. Paul deals clearly with the matter in Galatians 1:8: "But even if we, or an **[angel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/angels.html)** from heaven, preach any other gospel to you than what we have preached to you, **[let him be accursed](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anathema.htm)**."

The Scriptures teach us that the end of the age will not come until there is a great falling away or apostasy. The extent of the apostasy that is sweeping this country could not be more clearly evidenced than by the example of Last Days Ministries' recent catalogue of "Ministry Stuff." On the front cover amid pictures of **[Charles Finney](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-finney.html)**, Jesus Christ, and Keith Green, in the center was a picture of Mother Teresa! They were selling her video with this comment, "We can't recommend it enough." Clearly doctrines of demons.

> "Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house nor greet him; for he who greets him shares in his evil deeds" (2 John 9-11).

With those who participate with us on our mission trips to Mexico, we try to encourage each person to be a "Berean," to study the Word of God carefully for themselves so that they will know the real doctrine of Christ from the counterfeit doctrines that are being so successfully promoted today. Truth is being sacrificed on the altar of unity.

**[Satan](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html)** is using everything in his power to promote counterfeit Christianity to the detriment of those who accept his doctrines. Jesus clearly taught that not everyone who calls Him Lord will enter Heaven (Mt. 7:21) but rather only those who obey the Father.

It is clear to me that if anyone walks in any way with the greatest counterfeit on the face of the earth today (Roman Catholicism), they will walk with her in **[eternity](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternity.html)**.

The greatest challenge we have as Christians today in the United States is to keep ourselves unpolluted by counterfeit Christians because they promote counterfeit Christianity. We must study carefully to know the true doctrine of Christ and reject the counterfeit.

Exposing the **[deeds of darkness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/deeds.htm)** (Eph. 5:11): It is interesting to note that recently because of intense successful counterfeiting, the U.S. Treasury has had to redesign the $100 bill. These new bills are now in circulation. It is painfully clear that the simple gospel of Jesus Christ is being intensely counterfeited as well. Through the door of self exaltation has come the twisted gospel that God is to be the servant of man rather than the truth, which is that man is to be the servant of God. Jesus said it very simply in Mt. 16:24, "If anyone desires to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me!" Love of self leads to fear of man ... Fear of man leads to compromise ... Compromise leads to disobedience ... Disobedience leads to disqualification. Mt. 7:21-23\. Not everyone who calls Jesus Lord will enter Heaven.

The Word of God teaches us that we are all born with the disposition of "my right to myself." The gospel is that Jesus Christ came to free us from that disposition and give us a new disposition; the disposition to obey God, to be His servant and not a servant of self.
