## YES! Catholics DO Pray TO Mary

**I have noticed over the years how various _cults_ tend to deny, **at times, their own teachings that they cherish. It seems they do this to help make their religion seem more _[Christian](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html)_ and acceptable than it actually is, especially when conversing with a possible convert or one that has influence.**

Catholics do this very thing regarding _praying to Mary_, that is, sometimes Catholics will deny (lie) that they pray _**to**_ Mary. They attempt to cover over this fact by stating they pray _**through**_ Mary only. While it is true they pray _through_ Mary, **they also pray _directly to_ Mary** and this is _easily proven_. The following is one of their own prayers to Mary that was written by a man they have exalted to _sainthood_ after his death, **[Alphonsus Liguori](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/alphonsus-liguori.html)**. These prayers to Mary (including the others which follow) are taken from _My Prayer Book_ printed by Regina Press and copyrighted in 1981\. This book contains the _Nihil Obstat_ from Otto L. Garcia, j.c.d. and the _Imprimatur_ from Francis J. Mugavero, d.d., Bishop of Brooklyn, NY. (All emphasis in these prayers is my own):

## Alphonsus Liguori Did Pray TO Mary

> O Most holy and Immaculate **Virgin, my Mother**; you are the Mother of my Lord, the **Queen of the world, the advocate,  hope, the refuge of sinners**, and I, the most miserable of those sinners, come to you today.

> **I venerate you, great Queen**, and thank you for the many **graces** that you have bestowed upon me, and I especially want to **thank you for having **saved me** many times from the punishment of God**, a punishment which I deserved.

> I love you, most lovable Lady, and by the love I have for you, I promise that **I will always serve you** and do as much as I can to make others love you. **<u>I put all of my hope and my entire salvation in you.</u>**

> **Receive me as your servant, O Mother of Mercy**, and cover me with **the mantle of your protection.**

> Since you are so powerful with God, **free me from all temptations** or, at least, **obtain the graces for me to overcome them until death.**

> I ask of you a true love for Jesus Christ, and through you I hope to die a good death. My Mother, by the love you have for God, **I beg you to always help me**, especially at the last moment of my life.

> **Do not leave me until you see me safe in heaven.**

> I hope to thank and **praise you there for ever**. [pages 209, 210.]

 

Alphonsus Liguori was also exalted by the Catholic Church and given the honored title of **_Doctor_**. This is especially significant when one realizes there are less than three dozen total _doctors_ that the Catholic church recognizes.

If you carefully read over that prayer **_to_** Mary and know the New Testament message, it is painfully clear that **Catholicism has dangerously fabricated a “Mary” and exalted her to the position that Christians carefully reserve for _only_ God and the Lord Jesus.**

Furthermore, it is beyond question that _idolatry_ is a foundation to Catholicism’s doctrine of Mary, as is also shown from the above and elsewhere.

In addition, **the Mary of Catholicism allegedly has a major role in _salvation_ itself. In fact, Ligouri showed by the above prayer that he was trusting in Mary 100% for his salvation with no mention of Jesus. **This single error in doctrine is enough to send one to _**[hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html)**._

## More Evidence of Catholic Prayers TO Mary

Unfortunately, a prayer like that to Mary is not isolated. Notice the similar concepts in the following prayer to Mary under the heading of _In honor of Our Lady of Czestochowa:_

> Holy Mother of Czestochowa, full of grace and goodness, I bring my thoughts, my words and actions for your blessing. Bless my life and bless your people and make us free. Give us joy amidst suffering and strength in persecution. **Guide our ways on earth and bring us to eternal life**.  Amen. [ibid., p. 168.]

Yet a different prayer to Mary reads:

> . . . Since you are the ever Virgin Mary and Mother of the true God, **obtain for us from your most holy Son the grace of keeping our faith**, sweet hope in the midst of the bitterness of life, burning charity and **the precious gift of final perseverance**. We ask this through our Lord Jesus Christ, your Son, who lives and reigns with you and the Holy Spirit, one God, for ever and ever. Amen [ibid., p. 167].

Then we have _The Thirty Days’ Prayer to the Blessed Virgin Mary._ The last part of that prayer is cited below:

> . . . Obtain for me likewise, O sacred Mother of God, perseverance in good works, performance of good resolution, mortification of self-will, a pious conversation through life and, **at my last moments, strong and sincere repentance**, accompanied with such a lively and attentive presence of mind, as may enable me worthily to receive the last Sacraments of the Church, and **die in your friendship and favor.**

> Lastly, obtain, I beseech you, for the souls of my parents, brethren, relatives, and benefactors, both living and dead, **life everlasting**. Amen. [ibid., p. 220].

It is pitifully sad to know that nearly one billion Catholics are believing such things about a non-existent Mary that slowly developed over the centuries into their present-tense “life, sweetness and hope,” as unashamedly declared in the **[Rosary](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/rosary.html)**. **To be more precise, the Mary of Catholicism is _not_ the Mary of the Bible, but instead an invented and dreamed-up, sinless, queen of heaven who is supposed to be the mediatrix and dispenser of all _graces_.** The Mary of Catholicism doesn’t exist anymore than Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny. Again, their Mary is **_not_** the Mary of the Bible, but instead a counterfeit and spiritually deadly replacement for the Lord Jesus and God himself. She has no role in obtaining everlasting life for us, final perseverance, grace to overcome, etc. If you place **_your hope for entire salvation in her_ (as shown by the above prayers) you will surely perish_._ Please be aware of this.**


## Remove All Doubt

Rather than wondering if these statements are true or not, **please read through the entire New Testament _for yourself_ and learn God’s truth first hand.** You will quickly notice that the real Mary is hardly mentioned and **_never_ has any role in obtaining grace, protection or _salvation_.** She has no special influence with God through the Lord Jesus, as show when the 120 were gathered together in the Upper Room. The real Mary was present there and prayer was offered to God **_without_** her special intercession or help.

At Cana, Mary had no more influence with Jesus to perform a **[miracle](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/miracles.html)** than Jairus had in Mark 5:22-42; the unnamed Canaanite woman of Mt. 15:22-28; etc.

Be assured that this information is accurate, was written in **true Christian love** and with the desire that some will love the truth and find the **real salvation that only comes from _turning from all sin_ and _placing a submissive faith in the Lord Jesus (our real life, sweetness and hope) for salvation_**. This is written to help you, not hurt you.

Our _love_ for Catholics is so great that we are willing to be hated, falsely labeled _Catholic bashers_, and other untrue names, etc. to get this information about salvation to you. **It is not being loving or merciful to treat a sincere Catholic as a _Christian_ when he has been grossly and fatally deceived by his leaders, including the Catholic apologetic teachers.**

If the Catholic Church ever had the truth about _salvation_, it could never endorse such evil prayers and/or a teacher such as Liguori. Neither could those other Catholic leaders endorse this prayer book from which these prayers were quoted. To do so only helps reveal its _idolatrous_ doctrinal position that continues to remain within this religious system about their counterfeit Mary and salvation plan, as well as, continuing to stumble sincere people into hell.


## Don't Stumble Over Praying TO Mary

The **[Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)** cites one occasion where a woman tried to exalt Mary on the basis that she gave birth to Jesus and raised him, _just like Catholicism does today._ **The Lord Jesus quickly and publicly rebuked and refuted **that concept so no one would stumble:**

> As Jesus was saying these things, a woman in the crowd called out, “Blessed is the mother who gave you birth and nursed you.” He replied, **“Blessed rather are those who hear the word of God and obey it”** (Luke 11:27,28).

**Be assured that _you_ can trust the Bible to know God’s truth far more than any person, including your own priest or family. In fact, your eternal destiny depends on what you do with the Biblical message. GOD BLESS YOU.**
