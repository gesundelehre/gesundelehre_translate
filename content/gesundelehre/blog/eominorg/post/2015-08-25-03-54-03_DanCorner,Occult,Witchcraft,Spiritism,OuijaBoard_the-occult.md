## The Spiritual DANGERS of the Occult

**The word _occult_ means _hidden._ It is a dark power and practice strictly forbidden by God being disallowed in Scripture. It is soul damning sin:**

[![](../../files/pictures/never-call-on-an-angel.jpg "angels spiritual deception")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/religious-deception.html)

> When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, **do not learn to imitate the detestable ways of the nations there. Let no one be found among you who** sacrifices his son or daughter in the fire, who **practices divination or sorcery, interprets omens, engages in witchcraft, or casts spells, or who is a medium or [spiritist](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritism.htm) or who consults the dead. Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD,** and because of these detestable practices the LORD your God will drive out those nations before you. (Deu 18:9-12)

> But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, **those who practice MAGIC ARTS,** the idolaters and all liars--**their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death.** (Rev 21:8)

The dangers of the occult will therefore extend far beyond this life. They will stretch into eternity and the lake of fire for unrepentant occultists. Occult dangers are therefore of the **[greatest danger that exists](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/greatest-danger.html)**! It must also be stressed that occult new age _spirit guides_ are really demons. In fact, demons are the real and only power behind the occult! The danger of witchcraft is a form of **[religious deception](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/religious-deception.html)** which may include miracles and even accurate predictions at times. The tools used range from the ouija boards to crystal balls. Harry Potter, though fictitious, represents a wizard and is no wholesome role model for children or adults. Take warning and avoid the occult. IF you have been involved in the occult and desire to be set free and forgiven, repent and go to the Lord Jesus in humble and sincere prayer for mercy.

Have nothing to do with palmistry, tea leaf reading, Tarot card reading, crystal reading, Ouija boards, astrology, horoscopes or black magic in any form! "Why?" you may ask. Because ALL of these are condemned by the Bible! They are not good, but evil, according to the Creator of this universe. You will become spiritually defiled by just seeking out such.
