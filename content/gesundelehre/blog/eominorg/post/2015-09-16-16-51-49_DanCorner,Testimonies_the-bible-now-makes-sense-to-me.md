# The Bible Now Makes Sense to Me!

### Chris

![](../../files/pictures/006.gif)

For the longest time, I have had doubts about OSAS [[once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)]. The Bible never made much sense to me during the time I believed in OSAS, because **that doctrine went against what the Bible teaches.** I know all about the cop-outs pastors use, saying that people who go back into sin were “never saved at all.” I was saved at age 7, but never got grounded in sound doctrine. **I recently decided to repent of my sins and return to Christ.** I was into internet porn, beer, and wicked music. **I was believing the lie that I was eternally secure.** I had enough! **When I first visited your website, I hated you. But now I know that you are teaching the truth. I had no other choice but to give up my belief in OSAS.**

This week, I poured my beer in the sink and NEVER LOOKED BACK!!!! I destroyed my favorite rock music cd with NO REGRETS!!! And I will only use the internet for the glory of God! **The Bible now makes sense to me!**
