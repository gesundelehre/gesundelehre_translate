Under the Apostle Peter's freedom message, could he be allowing for an occasional act of getting drunk or being sexually immoral, as some Once Saved Always Saved proponents say is _permissible?_ ___Yes ___No

73\. Does it follow then, if someone teaches a _freedom_ or liberty message that allows for an occasional getting drunk or act of sexual immorality, that he is teaching falsely and should be openly refuted? ___Yes ___No

82\. Is it an **impossibility** for them to do so? ___Yes ___No

84\. Though a **warning** is alarming when we first hear it, it **is always advantageous** to be warned, because it alerts us to a real danger. Regarding this advantage, aren't all people who listen to Once Saved Always Saved teaching at a major spiritual disadvantage, for this type of warning of not inheriting the kingdom of God will **never** be issued to a Christian and will even be flatly denied? ___Yes ___No

85\. The Apostle Paul wrote, "This righteousness from God comes through faith in Jesus Christ to all who **believe**," Rom. 3:22\.

118\. Did Paul believe that **[God's sovereignty](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/Godswill.htm)**, love, faithfulness or keeping power for that convert would prevent him from falling under the same condemnation as the devil? ___Yes ___No

125\. Is the _second death_ the same thing as the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8)? ___Yes ___No

126\. Therefore, must a Christian be faithful till the point of death to escape the lake of fire? ___Yes ___No

127\. **All who inherit the kingdom of God receive the crown of life**. We know this since the crown of life is promised to those who truly love God (Jam. 1:12) and those who truly love God will inherit the kingdom of God (Jam. 2:5). The crown of life is, therefore, not something that only some Christians will receive, as taught by the Once Saved Always Saved teachers. ___True ___False
