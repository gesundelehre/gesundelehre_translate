## EXPOSING Paul Washer For The Sake of TRUTH

![Paul Washer once saved always saved](../../files/pictures/PaulWasher.jpg)

**_Who is Paul Washer?_** In a nutshell, Paul Washer is just another _Calvinist_, who adheres to the typical but fallacious **[doctrine of eternal salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/getsaved.html)**. We need know nothing else. Because Paul Washer adheres to the teachings of **[John Calvin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/johncalvin.html)**, **and by exalting George Whitefield and the cigar-smoking [Charles Spurgeon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spurgeon.html), he shows himself to be misled and is _leading others astray._** Paul Washer (born in 1961 and former Baptist missionary to Peru) is also _the minister_ of his gospel at _HeartCry Missionary Society._ So what does that entail? Read it for yourself from his doctrinal statement:

![Paul Washer Gets The Skull And Crossbones Award](../../files/pictures/snc.jpg)

> **PERSEVERANCE OF THE SAINTS. Those whom God has accepted in the Beloved, and sanctified by His Spirit, will <u>never totally nor finally fall away from the state of [**grace**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/true-grace-false-grace.html)</u>, but shall certainly persevere to the end; and though they may fall, through neglect and temptation, into sin, whereby they grieve the Spirit, impair their graces and comforts, bring reproach on the Church, and temporal judgments on themselves, yet they shall be renewed again unto repentance, and be kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.**

[![](../../files/pictures/how-did-david-die.jpg "paul washer eternal security eternal salvation")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html)

**That is spiritual poison**. Paul Washer believes in _**[once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**_ like **[Ray Comfort](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/raycomfort.html)**, R. C. Sproul and others. Paul Washer has a zeal, but it is _not_ based on knowledge. Paul Washer will try to convince you, as all eternal security proponents do, that **once a person becomes regenerated he will _forever_ remain a child of God, even if he terribly backslides. That is his understanding of eternal salvation! NOTE: At times when Paul Washer teaches his false version of salvation security it is similar to [John MacArthur](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/John-MacArthur.html) (a different Calvinist). They both teach a Christian can _fall away_ temporarily and partially, but _never totally or finally!_ Apparently, somehow both Paul Washer and John MacArthur (and all in the Reformed tradition) think must Solomon, who turned to idolatry in his latter years and never repented didn't _totally or finally fall away_! Paul Washer also teaches a true Christian can't be _[practice sinning](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/practice-sin.htm)_, but can sin like King David AND REMAIN SAVED! You will NEVER hear Paul Washer say that the adultery and murder committed by King David is proof David was never saved!** Again, **[Calvinist](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html)** Paul Washer believes King David was an example of an elect person who had backslid into adultery and murder, but that is not all. According to their dangerous doctrinal _fairytale_, David supposedly retained his salvation, which means you will too, even if you stray to that degree! ALL Calvinists, including Paul Washer, believes those who have become **_elected_** to eternal salvation are described in the following paragraph from their _Westminster Confession,_ Chapter 17, section 3:



## <a name="heretic%20paul%20washer"></a>The Revealing _Nevertheless_ Clause!

![Paul Washer Gets The Skull And Crossbones Award](../../files/pictures/snc.jpg)

> **Nevertheless,** they may, through the temptations of Satan and of the world, the prevalency of corruption remaining in them, and the neglect of the means of their preservation, **fall into grievous sins; and, for a time, continue therein:** whereby they incur God's displeasure, and grieve His Holy Spirit, come to be deprived of some measure of their graces and comforts, **have their hearts hardened,** and their consciences wounded; **hurt and scandalize others,** and bring temporal judgments upon themselves.

![paul washer](../../files/pictures/paul-washer.jpg)

That paragraph actually cites [**King David**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html) as an example, thus implying (as stated earlier) the adulterous and murderous can have salvation. Such a doctrine opens the door for **_all_** other forms of **_wickedness_**. To Calvinists there are Christian adulterers, Christian murderers, Christian thieves, Christian swindlers, etc. **Sometimes Calvinists, like Paul Washer, teach their message to present the illusion of teaching _holy_ living for salvation to dupe the unwary. Reader, don't be deceived by Paul Washer! ALL eternal security teachers are laying a _deadly snare_ before your feet. Paul Washer is no exception. KNOW THIS: PAUL WASHER DOES NOT TEACH HOLY LIVING FOR SALVATION BECAUSE HE BELIEVES KING DAVID RETAINED HIS SALVATION WHEN IN ADULTERY AND MURDER! He flatly denies the righteous will _die spiritually_ if they turn to evil (Ezek. 33:18)**

Paul Washer himself is just another victim of _Calvinism_, but at the same time he is leading others astray. To support Paul Washer's “mission” work is to spread _once saved always saved_ at the same time and share in the _wicked_ work of that teaching (2 Jn 9-11). Did you know Paul Washer is also wrong about _repentance?_ He WRONGLY teaches _**[repentance](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)**_ is **_simply a change of mind_**?

> What you need to understand is: **repentance** in its initial seed **is simply a changing of the mind.** (Paul Washer on Repentance, Don't Expect Instant Maturity)



## Debate Challenge Extended To Paul Washer

**Paul Washer, you are teaching the devil's lie that _the [righteous](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/righteous.html) can not*[die spiritually](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html) through sin (Gen. 3:4)._ I challenge you to a text, audio or video debate on eternal security. (You can pick.) Let’s place our exchanges on our web sites for the whole world to benefit by. You are spreading a _counterfeit and dangerous_ grace which has sent multitudes to hell in their sins, but don’t want to be challenged or exposed.** Will you debate me, Dan Corner, on this subject or just try to ignore that we exist? If you won't debate, WHY? Jesus and his disciples all debated. (This message was sent to Paul Washer on 05-04-09 and as of 10-21-14 he has NEVER responded!)

* * *

NOTE: ALL Calvinist, with NO exception, teach a license to sin. There doctrines related to key terms (grace, sin, **[eternal salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/getsaved.html)**, etc.) are warped and twisted! There is essentially no difference between any of them and **[Billy Graham once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesus-es.html)**.
