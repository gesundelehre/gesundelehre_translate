### [Debate Challenge on ETERNAL SECURITY](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/debate.htm) 
I, Dan Corner, openly challenge any and all qualified advocates of eternal security (also known as _once saved always saved_ or the _perseverance of the saints_) to publicly debate this issue with me in a fair, equally-timed exchange of ideas.

![eternal security Once Saved Always Saved](../../files/pictures/a-colorb.gif "eternal security Once Saved Always Saved")



## The Truth About _Eternal Security_ or _Once Saved Always Saved_ 
**The common and accepted _eternal security definition_ is, _once a person becomes saved by the grace of God he will ALWAYS remain saved._** Hence, that is why this teaching is often called **_once saved always saved_**.

[![eternal security verses john 10:28](../../files/pictures/john1028-never-perish.jpg "John 10:28 is the chief eternal security proof text.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john1028.html)  

The rest of the _eternal security definition_, though usually unspoken but understood, is: 

![eternal security doctrine once saved always saved](../../files/pictures/eternal-security-once-saved-always-saved-osas-license.jpg "Eternal security DESTROYS the fear of God to sin.") 

_**That Christian will remain saved regardless how far he backslides and plunges into sin, becomes lukewarm and unforgiving, bears no fruit, disowns Jesus and/or apostatizes doctrinally even to the point of becoming an atheist, [suicide](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/suicide.html), etc.!**_ The **[George Sodini](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/rick_knapp_george_sodini.htm)** homicides and suicide in 2009 are proof. **_Eternal security_ proponents think if one was ever saved, at any point in his life, he will always remain saved and his salvation is never jeopardized under any circumstances!** That is the only way they teach **[John 10:28](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john1028.html)** and their _never perish_ distortion from that verse. 

**Though popular, eternal security is an ear-tickling poisonous LIE often wrongly taught under _grace, the infinite work of Christ and Jesus' blood,_ which has caused MULTITUDES of unwary Christians to lower their guard and fall prey to [spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html). Such _twice lost_ people also do not recognize their vital need of _repentance for salvation._** Sometimes they will refer to themselves as a _Christian alcoholic, Christian addicted to pornography,_ etc. under their so-called _**[carnal Christian](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/carnal-christian-dave-hunt.htm)**_ label! Such people are actually described in 2 Peter 2:20-22, but too spiritually blinded to recognize it. 

 

## _Eternal Security_ Proponents Want It Both Ways 
Eternal security proponents want it both ways. Their other message is designed to conceal their obvious _**[license to sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/etlicense.html)**_, but only used with certain people, especially Christians _contending for the faith_ (Jude 3,4).

[![eternal security problem](../../files/pictures/eternal-security-problem.jpg "eternal security problem")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/futuresins.html)

Specifically that message taught by the **[eternal security teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal_security_teachers.html)** is their **[never saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm)** or **[false convert](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/falseconversion.html)** argument, which quickly becomes falsified in light of the time **[King David sinned](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html)**. **[Eternal security proponents never say _King David lost his salvation_ or _he was never saved_ before he fell into adultery and murder! Neither do they say that about [Solomon, who turned to idolatry](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/solomons-apostasy.html).]**

![once saved always saved sent many people to hell](../../files/pictures/osas-more-to-hell-jws-lds.jpg "once saved always saved sent many people to hell")
 

**It should also be noted that it is _logically inconsistent_ for any eternal security proponent to ever say another person was _never saved_ or _is not saved now_, based on their present tense sinful behavior, even if they are a Hindu, Muslim, witch doctor, child molester, serial killer, serial rapist, etc.! WHY? Because their doctrine says, if they, at any time in their entire life, had a saving faith, they are still saved because _once saved always saved, once in grace always in grace, once a son always a son!_** 

[![mythical god of eternal security](../../files/pictures/mythical-god-of-eternal-security.jpg "mythical god of eternal security")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mythical-god.html)

**[QUESTION: What Is The Greatest Doctrinal Threat To _Holiness_?](#eternalsecuritythreat)** 



## _Eternal Security_ Is An Ear-Tickling Poisonous LIE 

[![eternal security once saved always saved](../../files/pictures/what-if-you-are-wrong.jpg "What if you are wrong about eternal security?")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/what-if-you-are-wrong.htm)

Though it should never be, the lingering question for many remains: _Is once saved always saved or a conditional security the Biblical truth?_ **While some Bible believers embrace a conditional security in Christ (or NO eternal security) most professing Christians live in no fear of God or concern about sinning as they embrace _once saved always saved_.**

[![Eternal Security Once Saved Always Saved is a false gospel counterfeit grace](../../files/pictures/eternal-security-false-gospel-counterfeit-grace.jpg "Eternal Security Once Saved Always Saved is a false gospel counterfeit grace")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html)

Too many continue to be tossed back and forth on this **[salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)**-related issue, but this need not be the case. Below is a vast array of Bible-based teachings on this very crucial issue. They range from **[spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html) to [imputed righteousness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/esimputedrighteousness.html) to the false accusation of a [works salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/workssalvation.html), etc., which dismantle eternal security (or once saved always saved) piece by piece.** 

Beyond all of that, available here are various anti eternal security audio and video interviews as well as a few **_[eternal security debates](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/scradio.html)_ [on radio](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/scradio.html)** with **[Dan Corner](http://www.dancorner.com/)**. He is the author of the 801 page book, "[**The Believer's Conditional Security: Eternal Security Refuted**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelical-books.html)," the most exhaustive book ever written refuting eternal security. 

[![The Believer's Conditional Security: Eternal Security Refuted](../../files/pictures/no-eternal-security-BOOK-2.jpg "The Believer's Conditional Security: Eternal Security Refuted")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelical-books.html)

**[Click on book picture to the right to order with FREE materials and prompt shipment.]** That **[book has helped many spiritually](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bcstestimonies.htm)**. "**[The Myth of Eternal Security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelical-books.html)**" (230 pages) is another powerful book refuting _once saved always saved._ **All of the following will help you better understand this massive problem with eternal security and how to counter it.** Please don't be duped by the popularity of once saved always saved. It is NOT Biblical even though various scriptures, such as **[John 10:28](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john1028.html)** and **[Phil. 1:6](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/phil1.6.htm)**, have been misused as backing. The only **_assurance of salvation_** is for the present-tense follower of Jesus - those who _have_ [present tense] the Son (1 John 5:12). 



## [Listen To This Testimony Of How Eternal Security Led To Immorality (MP3)](http://media10.cqservers.com/evangelicaloutreach.org/davidstestimony.mp3) 
Be assured that _**[Evangelical](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelicals.htm)** Outreach_ does not teach a _works salvation or legalism_.

![eternal security snare](../../files/pictures/eternal-security-is-a-deadly-snare.jpg "eternal security snare")

Those are some of the _strawman_ arguments and **[misconceptions about a conditional salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/misconceptions.html)** used to smear our **[Christian beliefs](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-beliefs.html)**. **[Dan Corner](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dancorner.html)** teaches we are saved by grace (Eph. 2:8,9) but **we can fall from grace** (Gal. 5:2-4). We are justified by faith (Rom. 5:1) but **our faith can become shipwrecked** (1 Tim. 1:19,20) and **cease to exist** (Lk. 8:13; Rom. 11:19-23). We are not under the law (Rom. 6:14,15) but **if you live according to the sinful nature you will die** (Rom. 8:13). Paul taught against legalism (Gal. 5:3,4) but he also taught that **no immoral, impure or greedy person has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God** (Eph. 5:5-7). 

[![no eternal security](../../files/pictures/Jesus-disowned-peter.jpg "no eternal security")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lose-salvation.html)

We are not saved by works (Eph. 2:8,9) but **to reap eternal life and not destruction you must sow to please the Spirit and not the sinful nature** (Gal. 6:8,9). God is faithful to us (1 Jn. 1:9; 1 Cor. 10:13) but **we must be faithful to him to the very end of our lives to escape the lake of fire or second death** (Rev. 2:10,11). God surely loves us (Jn. 3:16; Mk. 10:21; Rom. 8:35-39) but **those who inherit the kingdom of God _love God_** (Jam 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:9) and to love God means to **obey his commands** (Jn. 14:15; 1 Jn. 5:3). We have **_freedom in Christ_** (Gal. 5:1) but this **freedom is not to indulge the sinful nature** (Gal. 5:13; 1 Pet 2:16). God is to be **[obeyed](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/obey.html)** and **[feared](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/feargod.htm)**, but that is not the mythical god of eternal security. **The [mythical god of eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mythical-god.html) can't see your sins for he only sees the blood of Christ and grace; he is holding you and keeping you regardless how you act and believe after initial salvation; you can even disown him, but he will never disown you in contrast to Mt. 10:33 and 2 Tim. 2:12!That in brief is the false god of once saved always saved that so many think they can _mock_ and still reap eternal life (Gal. 6:7-9)!**

**One of the greatest unrecognized spiritual dangers for those who believe the Bible and that we are saved by grace and not by works (Eph. 2:8,9) is the [doctrine of demons](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/doctrine-of-demons.html) and [false gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html) of _eternal security (once saved always saved)._ The [eternal security teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html) are very dangerous people, but are exalted and supported even by those who supposedly don't believe in once saved always saved! No doubt [Joseph Prince salary](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/joseph-prince-destined-to-reign.html) is pumped up because of this!**

[![Eternal security teacher](../../files/pictures/eternal-security-teachers-evil.jpg "eternal security teacher")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html)

**[The Righteous Can Die Spiritually](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)** 
> There are many death blows to **_eternal security_ (or _once saved always saved_**) found in Scripture. At the very core of this non-Christian doctrine is the concept that a person once saved (a righteous person) can not experience **[spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)** over any sin. The clarity of the Scriptures to the contrary is overwhelming from Genesis through Revelation. **_Spiritual death_ is NOT the same as _eternal damnation._**

**[Eternal Security Is Another Gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html)** 
> _Eternal security_ is a **[false gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html)** and counterfeit grace message, which is built upon partial truths and Scripture removed from its context. **Many are in hell now because of the _once saved always saved doctrine_**. 


**[Imputed Righteousness And _Eternal Security_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/esimputedrighteousness.html)**

[![eternal security once saved always saved conditional salvation](../../files/pictures/eternal-security-hebrews-314.png "This is GRACE as taught in first century Christianity.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lose.htm) 
> From the viewpoint of Calvinism and the eternal security proponent, **[imputed righteousness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/esimputedrighteousness.html)** simply stated is: a person once saved is holy and righteous without living holy and righteously. The _once saved always saved_ lie is foundational to their dark view. 

**[The Never Really Saved Argument Scrutinized](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm)** 
> **From the viewpoint of an eternal security proponent, _once saved always saved_ is foundational to grace and salvation. If _eternal security_ is challenged, in defense they often revert to their _[never saved to begin with](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm)_ argument which confuses the issue and is easy to refute. Here is the proof.** 

**[Eternal Security And The Sin Unto Death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sinuntodeath.html)** 
> **You will probably never hear any eternal security teacher say outrightly their doctrine is a _license for immorality_**. In fact, they will most often flatly deny this charge sometimes to the point of yelling slander. However, there are still various ways these **_eternal security_** people teach this very thing they hate to be identified with. Certainly one is through their version of the sin unto death. 

**[The Gospel According To Charles Stanley](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-stanley.html)**

[![eternal security once saved always saved eternal life](../../files/pictures/romans2-7.jpg "This is GRACE teaching regarding ETERNAL LIFE, but hated in our day.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans-road.htm) 
> **[Charles Stanley eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-stanley.html) is a definite license to sin. Stanley is the number 1 most influential _once saved always saved Baptist teacher_ in the world. That _eternal security Baptist_ has spread that false gospel in various ways including in his book entitled, _Eternal Security: Can You Be Sure_. Here is a Biblical refutation of that book with his false gospel of once saved always saved. The Bible teaches _once saved NOT always saved._** 

**[The Sinful Lifestyles Of The Eternal Security Proponents](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eslifestyle.htm)**

[![charles stanley eternal security](../../files/pictures/charles-stanley-eternal-security.jpg "charles stanley eternal security")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-stanley.html) 
> For a Christian to believe any _once saved always saved_ proponent is living holy is a contradiction to both the embraced doctrine cherished by that once saved always saved proponent and what the Bible declares about a sinner, a slave to sin and those not obeying God, which _once saved always saved_ people identify themself as. 

**[Eternal Security: A Doctrine of Demons](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/doctrine-of-demons.html)** 
> Some teachings originate with demons (1 Tim. 4:1)! Even the devil can quote Scripture (Mt. 4:6), so we must be on guard because teachings of demons will not necessarily be filled with apparent holes. Is it ludicrous for a "doctrine of demons" to come through respected and popular _eternal security_ teachers? Be on your guard always especially with the _KJV once saved always saved_ proponents. 

**[The Image of a Christian In Our Present-Day](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/image-of-a-christian.htm)** 
> The _image of a Christian_ now is a sinister, evil and ugly distortion which allows for gross wickedness and salvation too. It is a powerless and unholy image. The **_once saved always saved_ (or _eternal security_**) lie has been accepted, treasured and defended by people who love a lie. 

[![once saved always saved eternal security](../../files/pictures/gal689-once-saved-always-saved-rewards-eternal-life.jpg "Gal. 6:8,9 is a SALVATION passage, not a REWARDS passage!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternallife.html)

**[True or False Conversion is Not The Big Issue](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/falseconversion.html)** 
> The real issue isn't if one was truly saved or not (even though that is important), but instead is he saved now. **Since _eternal security_ is false, once saved always saved refuted needs to be the catalyst of our teaching.** 

**[1 Cor. 5:5 and Calvinism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/1cor55_calvinism.htm)**

> Jimmy Swaggart teaches a license to sin though he openly denies believing in _unconditional eternal security_ (another way of referring to once saved always saved or eternal security). He says he believes in _conditional eternal security_ (which is a non-existent made up term, which only confuses the issue more).

**[Once Saved Always Saved Is Not An In House Debate](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/notinhousedebate.htm)** 
> Part of the message of the **_eternal security_ (or _once saved always saved_**) teachers is that the disagreement between Christians who reject _eternal security_ and those who hold to this security-in-sin gospel (a better way to identify the eternal security doctrine) is that it is an in house debate. Friends, be assured the _once saved always saved debate_ clearly concludes with a _conditional security for the believer in Christ._

**[The Perseverance of the Saints Version of Eternal Security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/perseverance-of-the-saints.htm)** 
> Calvinism is a total perversion of grace, how one gets saved, God's sovereignty, etc. But specifically related to **_eternal security_ (or _once saved always saved_**), the fifth point of Calvinism dangerously downplays the seriousness of sin in the life of a believer and its version of eternal security is the most deceitful and inconsistent of the two. People who claim to believe in the _eternal security of the believer_ are either ignorant or trying to confuse the issue, since _eternal security_ is a heresy and has nothing to do with the believer in Christ.

> We have received many emails over the years from eternal security (or once saved always saved) people either stating that all Christians are sinners or that they must continue to sin all the time in this life. This article is written for the express purpose of shedding Biblical light on this subject.

> How is it possible for false doctrine to run rampant in a day with so many Bibles within easy reach? In part, it is because false teachers are convincingly presenting a partial truth as the whole truth and distorting its intended meaning. 

**[What's Wrong With The American Church?](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/1cor5.htm)**

**[The Real Importance of Obedience to God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/obey.html)** 
> According to today's version of grace, obedience to God is optional and, therefore, not even a priority for many. But is that the real truth or a lie from the devil, who is trying to damn your soul to Hell through false teachings, which come from the devil's servants?

**[The Sinful Lifestyles Of The Eternal Security Proponents](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eslifestyle.htm)** 
> To say that a Christian can commit adultery and not be an adulterer is to teach both a deadly lie and a license for immorality at the same time, even though you might claim to reject eternal security! It only takes one act of murder or adultery to be a bible-defined murderer or adulterer, according to Scripture. Once saved always saved is demonic.

> Sometimes connected with the freedom in Christ message is Rom. 7:14-20: "We know that the law is spiritual; but I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin. I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do." What is the Apostle Paul teaching?

**[Antinomianism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/antinomianism.htm)** 
> The word antinomianism comes from the Greek anti (against) and nomos (law). It refers to the doctrine that it is not necessary for Christians to obey the moral law. In other words, faith frees the Christian from such obligations. 

**[Suicide, A Quick Ticket To Hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/suicide.html)** 
> Suicide is commonly defined as the taking of one's own life. Tens of thousands of people a year in the United States alone commit this act. Many do that because they believe in once saved always saved! 

**[Taking The Scissors To 1 Cor. 15:2](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/scissors.htm)** 
> When the eternal security teachers refer to the gospel from 1 Cor. 15:1-4, they often make a point of avoiding verse 2! They usually do this by starting to read or write at verse 3 and just mentioning, in passing, the subject of Paul's gospel from verse 1\. Why do you suppose those clear and powerful words from verse 2 are omitted? 

**[Did Jesus Teach Eternal Security (Or Perseverance Of The Saints)?](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesus-es.html)** 
> If you're like most people, you'll be shocked to find out Jesus definitely did NOT teach once saved always saved! In fact, he was against eternal security.

> **25 of the chief arguments for _unconditional eternal security_ (or once saved always saved) are examined and answered.** Hundreds of eternal security proponents, including some Reformed apologists, have read this first book written by Dan Corner. It has never been refuted with Scripture, nor can it be, though some have made a feeble attempt! [Please also see the information on his new 801 page book entitled, **_[The Believer's Conditional Security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dan-corner-the-believers-conditional-security.html)_** -- the most exhaustive refutation to once saved always saved that has ever been written!] 
> The first book includes the most common arguments and proof texts used by the perseverance of the saints teachers -- solidly refuting them with Scripture; fourteen Biblical examples of people who once had a saving faith but later lost it; seventeen important safeguards to keep this from happening to you and your loved ones, and much more!

> Once saved always saved proponents face many difficult passages of Scripture, that is, difficult for them because they clearly contradict their treasured and beloved doctrine. The contradictions from Scripture concerning their teaching exist either by specific example or simple declaration pertaining to this subject. Regarding examples that contradict eternal security, perhaps the Apostle Judas Iscariot is most difficult for them. 

**[Wesley's Perseverance](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wesley.htm)** 
> John Wesley had a foundation in Greek, Hebrew and Latin, preached approximately 40,000 sermons and traveled 225,000 miles, mostly on horseback. The number of works he wrote, translated or edited exceeds 200\. This article on the fifth point of Calvinism is essential reading for every Christian.

Do you want proof that eternal security (once saved always saved) leads to criminal acts? Here it is! Read it for yourself from a prisoner. The following are his exact words: 
> I have enjoyed reading The Believer's Conditional Security. It has answered a lot of questions that I have had in the past and even now. It explains to me how I ended up here in prison - wrong theology. It has made me open up the Bible more and study it more intently ... 

Besides that, there was **[George Sodini](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/rick_knapp_george_sodini.htm)**, a once saved always saved proponent, who murdered 3 women then himself. He was DECEIVED INTO THINKING that even murder would not negate his salvation. He was so deceived the truth about a conditional salvation was not allowed in his belief system. He was so deceived the truth about a conditional salvation was not allowed in his belief system. There is no doubt that our society would be a much better place WITHOUT the false gospel and counterfeit grace message of eternal security!
