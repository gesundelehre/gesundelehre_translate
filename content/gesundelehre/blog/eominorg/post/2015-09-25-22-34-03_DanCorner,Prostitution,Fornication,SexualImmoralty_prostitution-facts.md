## Biblical Prostitution Facts, Prostitutes and Victims

**Do you want _prostitution facts?_ If so, you are about to read the most detailed and relevant information available about those involved in _prostitution_ (the _prostitute_) and their many victims. These _prostitution facts_ are special because they are from the Word of God.** Among other things, this information may surprise you just to learn who she actually is, how she acts and what her victims are likened unto. You will also learn the Biblical definition of a _prostitute_, which is certainly different from what most think and how it differs from the traditional dictionary definition. God’s word says much about the _prostitute,_ the wickedness associated with _prostitution_ (sexual sin), how to protect yourself from this and how to get free:

> For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the corrections of discipline are the way to life, keeping you from **the immoral woman**, from the smooth tongue of **the wayward wife.** Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes, for the **prostitute** reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the **adulteress** preys upon your very life. Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned? Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched? So is he who sleeps with **another man’s wife;** no one who touches her will go unpunished. Men do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his hunger when he is starving. Yet if he is caught, he must pay sevenfold, though it costs him all the wealth of his house. But **a man who commits adultery lacks judgment; whoever does so destroys himself. Blows and disgrace are his lot, and his shame will never be wiped away;** for jealousy arouses a husband’s fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge. He will not accept any compensation; he will refuse the bribe, however great it is. My son, keep my words and store up my commands within you. Keep my commands and you will live; guard my teachings as the apple of your eye. Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. Say to wisdom, “You are my sister,” and call understanding your kinsman; they will keep you from the **adulteress**, from the **wayward wife** with her seductive words. At the window of my house I looked out through the lattice. I saw among the simple, I noticed among the young men, **a youth who lacked judgment.** He was going down the street near her corner, walking along in the direction of her house at twilight, as the day was fading, as the dark of night set in. Then out came a woman to meet him, **dressed like a prostitute** and with crafty intent. (She is loud and defiant, her feet never stay at home; now in the street, now in the squares, at every corner she lurks.) She took hold of him and kissed him and with a brazen face she said: “I have fellowship offerings at home; today I fulfilled my vows. So I came out to meet you; I looked for you and have found you! I have covered my bed with colored linens from Egypt. I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes and cinnamon. Come, let’s drink deep of love till morning; let’s enjoy ourselves with love! **My husband is not at home**; he has gone on a long journey. He took his purse filled with money and will not be home till full moon.” With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. All at once he followed her **like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life**. Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say. Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths. <span style="color: #ff0000">**Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng. Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death**</span> (Prov. 6:23-7:27).

## Infidelity Related To Prostitution</font>

Such a wayward, adulterous wife (prostitute) has brought down many victims. Her slain are a mighty throng. “Her house is the way to hell” is the rendering of verse 27 in several translations (KJV, MKJV, NKJV, God’sWord). Many other Scriptures show any kind of sexual sin will send one to the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8; 1 Cor. 6:9,10; Eph. 5:5-7; Mt. 5:28,29; Gal. 5:19-21; Jude 7; etc.).



## Tamar Was A _Prostitute_ In Genesis

_**Prostitution_ is very old** and dates back to Genesis:

> When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, for she had covered her face. Not realizing that she was his daughter-in-law, he went over to her by the roadside and said, “Come now, let me sleep with you.” “And what will you give me to sleep with you?” she asked. “I’ll send you a young goat from my flock,” he said. “Will you give me something as a pledge until you send it?” she asked. He said, “What pledge should I give you?” “Your seal and its cord, and the staff in your hand,” she answered. So he gave them to her and slept with her, and she became pregnant by him. (Gen 38:15-18)

The [**Prodigal**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/prodigal-son.html), in Jesus’ teaching in Luke 15, sinned with _prostitutes_ but came back to spiritual life, just like all others who are willing to sincerely and humbly repent and return to God to serve him. There was **NO** [**Eternal Security**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) for him and there is none for you!

## Godly Wisdom and Fear of God: Prostitution Protection

Besides all of that, _Godly wisdom_ has multiple sin-preventative benefits, including avoiding becoming the victim of a prostitute. Also, let’s not forget that _the fear of the LORD_ is the beginning of [Godly] wisdom (Psa. 111:10; Prov. 9:10). Many in our day lack this vital fear and therefore don’t have Godly wisdom and its benefits:

> Wisdom will save you from the ways of wicked men, from men whose words are perverse, who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways, who delight in doing wrong and rejoice in the perverseness of evil, whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways. **It will save you also from the adulteress, from the wayward wife with her seductive words, who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God. For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead.** (Prov. 2:12-18).

According to that passage, **the adulteress (or prostitute) is a divorcee—one who left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God.** Such a person involved in _prostitution_ will take you to <span style="color: #ff0000">**hell**</span> with her (unless you turn away from such wickedness and get Biblically forgiven). Though that type of sin may be common, that doesn’t mean it is less than SOUL-damning!



## An Adulteress = A Prostitute

According to the Scriptures, any _adulteress_ is a _prostitute_, **even if she doesn’t want money!** What a surprise that must be to many who have committed adultery, but would never think of themselves as a _prostitute_ or being involved in _prostitution_. Nonetheless, this is how God sees them. This truth should help all in this vile sin to recognize how heinous it is and to repent before it is too late and they get thrown into <span style="color: #ff0000">**the lake of fire:**</span>

But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the <span style="color: #ff0000">**sexually immoral**</span>, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars—their place will be in the <span style="color: #ff0000">**fiery lake of burning sulfur**</span>. This is the second death. (Rev 21:8)

We know from other Scriptures that **Rahab was a _prostitute_ who got saved** (James 2:25). Furthermore, [**Salvation**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html) and forgiveness is shown in the New Testament:

> Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God (1 Cor. 6:9-11, ESV).

Hence, if you have been or still are a prostitute or the victim of a prostitute—repent while you still can. ([**Repentance**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html) means to turn away from sin.) God has forgiven people who have repented and will do the same for you. This is most important and serious. You can and will get set free from your sin addictions and become a [**New Creation**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/new-creation.html), IF you act on these Scriptures.



## Bathsheba

Since an adulteress is a _prostitute_ and Bathsheba was an adulteress, then **Bathsheba was a prostitute, according to the Bible.** Bathesheba was also religious and beautiful yet took a bath where others could view her naked body. Such wickedness led to David sinning with her.

Finally, the Bible also likens a _prostitute_ to a _bandit_ among other things:

> For a prostitute is a deep pit and a wayward wife is a narrow well. Like a **bandit** she lies in wait, and multiplies the unfaithful among men (Prov. 23:27, 28).

**Remember, the aforementioned prostitution facts are from the most authoritative source in the world - the Holy Bible!**
