## Miracles Of God and Satan Continue On

_**Miracles of God**_ **and the devil, do and have occurred!** That should be common knowledge, but too few know the important Biblical details and ramifications of such. Because people don't, they get lethally deceived. We also need to know how to tell miracles of God from Satanic miracles.

## _Satanic Miracles_ - Past and Future

When one reads through the book of Revelation, he can easily see that the terminal generation of this age will see and/or personally experience the effects of war, famine, martyrdom, gross sin and **deceit through _Satanic miracles!_** Unfortunately, many in our day don't recognize that **miracles do come through two supernatural sources -- God and the devil**! In the book of Exodus, we learn that **some of _God's miracles_ were duplicated by Satan's power channeled through the Egyptian [sorcerers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritism.htm) -- a wooden staff became a snake (7:10,11); water was changed into blood (7:20-22) and frogs came out of the water and covered the land (8:6,7)! [Demons](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/angels.html) can and do perform miraculous signs (Rev. 16:14)**. To be specific, we can be sure that our generation, if it is the last generation, will hear of or see in the future **fire coming down from Heaven to earth (Rev. 13:13) and an image of the [Antichrist](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/antichrist.html) speaking (Rev. 13:15) because of Satanic power! In fact, it will be because of such Satanic miracles that the ones who receive the infamous [mark of the beast in the bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/markbeast.html) and worship his image will be deceived (Rev. 19:20)**. [Please read and circle that verse in your own Bible for yourself.] They will be deceived by astounding and awe-inspiring miracles produced by **Satanic power!** See also 2 Thess. 2:9,10.



## More _Satanic Miracles_ From The Past

**Satan has in the past, is now and will continue in the future to use miracles to deceive.** This truth is the answer to the mystic questions regarding Edgar Cayce, Padre Pio, etc. who carried conflicting messages about God and the afterlife along with their signs and miracles. Similar conflicting messages surrounding miracles and visions are found in a comparison of [**Mormonism**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormon.html) and [**Catholicism**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html)**.** For example, AFTER prayer, the Mormons were saved by sea gulls which ate the crickets that were eating their grain in Brigham Young's day [_Truth Restored_ by Gordon B. Hinckley, 1979, pp. 106-108]. In contrast, the Catholic church endorsed with the highest honors the 1917 [**Fatima visions**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/fatima.html) of a personage claiming to be the **[Virgin Mary](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/virginity-of-mary.html)**, which declared herself as our "refuge" and "the way that will lead you to God." Such is in direct conflict with Jn. 14:6 which declares Jesus as the only "way" to **[God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.html)**! **Since Mormonism and Catholicism both have miracles and visions and their messages about salvation are in conflict with each other, we logically know that God can't be the only power source for these miracles and visions. We can be dogmatic, since God is not a God of confusion.** [God's power was NOT active in either of these cases!]

**What then must we gauge all messages and teachings by, since **miracles, visions, signs, etc. can be deceptive**? The criterion is [God's word](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wordgod.html) (2 Tim. 3:16,17). If God's word isn't considered as FINAL AUTHORITY when "testing" a _miracle_, vision, dream, prophecy, teaching, etc., one will probably be deceived and could possibly lose his soul! Did you know that if you are deceived by a miracle to [receive the mark of the beast](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/markbeast.html), YOU will end up in [Hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html), even if you were once saved (Rev. 14:9-12)?** We MUST be both "self-controlled" and "alert" to stand against the [**devil**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html) and his wiles (1 Pet 5:8; Eph. 6:10,11). To reflect upon the contents of this message until an indelible impression is made upon your mind might make a difference in your eternity beyond the grave! Remember, these are perilous days that call for discernment. **In conclusion, God still performs miracles in our day (Jn.14:12; Acts 4:30; etc.), but so does the devil (Rev. 16:14)! The Bible is [final authority](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html) and will help us distinguish the dangerous and deceptive _Satanic miracles_ from _miracles of God_.**
