_Eternal life_ to a Mormon is much different than for a Christian. The following is what a Mormon is to believe:

> Here, then, is **eternal life**- to know the only wise and true God; and **you have got to learn how to be gods yourselves, and to be kings and priests to God, the same as all gods have done before you,** namely, by going from one small degree to another, and from a small capacity to a great one; from grace to grace, exaltation to exaltation, until you attain to the resurrection of the dead, and are able to dwell in **everlasting burnings,** and to sit in glory, as do those who sit enthroned in everlasting power.... (Bruce R. McConkie, Mormon Doctrine, 1966, p. 321, italics theirs, bold emphasis mine)

As strange as that was, there is actually more which should make Christians cringe:

> And those who receive **it** [the Book Of Mormon, v.8] in faith, and work righteousness, shall receive a **crown of eternal life;** but those who harden their hearts in unbelief, and reject it, it shall turn to their own **condemnation** (Doc. & Cov. 20:14,15)

**[Mormonism teaches all other creeds are an abomination](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ldsabomination.htm) and just boldly _condemned_ all Christians who correctly reject the [Book of Mormon](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon-1.html). Mormonism has also made eternal life available for _only_ those who accept the _Book Of Mormon_ as Scripture!** That leads to a very serious and glaring problem for all Mormons! That problem is: Since the _Book of Mormon_ was discovered and translated in 1827, **how could anyone before that point have _eternal life_ since until the days of [Joseph Smith, Jr.](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormons.html), no one ever heard of it? Folks, don't be misled by the Mormon missionaries who want you to pray about the Book of Mormon. There is no need to [pray about the book of Mormon](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon.htm) since it came from a Bible-defined false prophet (Joseph Smith, Jr.). It can't be from God.**

The truth is, _**[eternal life](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternallife.html)**_ is both the life of God and what a person gets this side of the grave when he truly has the Lord Jesus Christ, who is eternal life:

> **And this is the testimony: God has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son. He who has the Son has life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have life.** I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life. (1 John 5:11-13)

> The life appeared; we have seen it and testify to it, and we proclaim to you the **eternal life,** which was with the Father and has appeared to us. (1 John 1:2)
