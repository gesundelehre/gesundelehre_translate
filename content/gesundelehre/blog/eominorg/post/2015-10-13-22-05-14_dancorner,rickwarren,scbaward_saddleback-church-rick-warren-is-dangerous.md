## Rick Warren of Saddleback Church is a DANGEROUS False Teacher!

**The famous Rick Warren of Saddleback Church gets the _Skull and Crossbones Award_ for teaching a [license for immorality](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/etlicense.html).** Rick Warren's Saddleback Church congregation is massive with approximately 20,000 people attending weekly, and **his book, _The Purpose Driven Life_, is the bestselling hardback in American history!** Over **30 million copies**  of _The Purpose Driven Life_ have been sold **worldwide**. His religious influence is gargantuan, yet **he teaches _the heresy_ ([once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)) in various ways and has certainly jeopardized many SOULS by doing so.** Somehow the **[devil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html)** has even gotten his popular book into various congregations, which are supposed to reject that artificial _grace_ message and false gospel.

![Rick Warren saddleback church](../../files/pictures/rick-warren.gif "Rick Warren of Saddleback Church and author of The Purpose Driven Life.")

On Rick Warren’s website (http://www.saddleback.com), he is very open and bold about this shameful belief. Under the section on _Eternal Security_, we read about his doctrinal belief which will adversely affect his view on many basic dogmas of the Bible:

![Rick Warren saddleback church](../../files/pictures/snc.jpg "Rick Warren of Saddleback Church get this Skull and Crossbones Award.")

> Because God gives man eternal life through Jesus Christ, **the believer is secure in salvation for eternity**. (emphasis mine)

That single sentence speaks volumes about **the _faulty and dangerous_ doctrinal views of Rick Warren on [sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html), [salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html), [grace](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/true-grace-false-grace.html), the Christian life, etc.,** but there is sadly much more.

## Rick Warren's _The Purpose Driven Life_ on Backslidden David

Getting back to his famous book, _The Purpose Driven Life_ (2002 edition), we read:

> **Of course, God hadn’t really left David, and he doesn’t leave you.** He has promised repeatedly, “I will _never_ leave you nor forsake you.” (page 108, bold emphasis mine)

![Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren of saddleback church](../../files/pictures/purpose-driven-life.jpg "The Purpose Drive Life book by Rick Warren")

Being consistent with _once saved always saved,_ **Rick Warren will downplay the seriousness of _any sin,_ including [David's adultery and murder](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html).** Though he didn’t touch on it, **he would categorically deny that David [died spiritually](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html) during that time, even though Scripture is clear:**

> If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil, **he will die for it.** (Ezek 33:18)

**Portraying David’s wickedness unlike how it actually was, Rick Warren says _God hadn’t really left David._ Then Rich Warren makes a blanket statement about allpeople who have ever been saved. That statement was, _he doesn’t leave you._ **Rick Warren’s theology screams out that _no sin can cause God to leave Christians, since they are saved and will always remain saved.__  _Perhaps he doesn’t know the Spirit of the Lord left Saul:**

> Now **the Spirit of the LORD had departed from Saul,** and an evil spirit from the LORD tormented him. (1 Sam 16:14)

The _**[never leave or forsake verse](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/forsake.html)** in Hebrews refers back to Deut. 31, where we read this:

> And the LORD said to Moses: “You are going to rest with your fathers, and these people will soon prostitute themselves to the foreign gods of the land they are entering. **They will forsake me** and break the covenant I made with them. **On that day I will become angry with them and forsake them**;  I will hide my face from them, and they will be destroyed. Many disasters and difficulties will come upon them, and on that day they will ask, ‘Have not these disasters come upon us because our God is not with us?’” (Deut 31:16,17)

Elsewhere we read this:

> He went out to meet Asa and said to him, “Listen to me, Asa and all Judah and Benjamin. The LORD is with you when you are with him. If you seek him, he will be found by you, but **if you forsake him, he will forsake you.**”  (2 Chron. 15:2)

![Purpose Driven Life by Rick Warren](../../files/pictures/rick-warren-time.jpg)

Rick Warren interprets the Bible differently because he views Scripture as though eternal security was true rather than a widespread heresy which Christians need to fight against. Hence, he has read once saved always saved into the _never leave or forsake_ verse when it is not there! The real truth is, God has NEVER said he would at no time forsake the unfaithful. The truth is, God will not _forsake **the faithful**:_

> For the LORD loves the just and **will not forsake his faithful ones**. (Psa 37:28)


## Rick Warren's Quote About Endangered _Fellowship_

Rick Warren also wants us also to believe:

> We grieve God’s Spirit and quench **our fellowship** with him **by disobedience**,  conflict with others, busyness, **friendship with the world, and other sins.** (ibid., page 109, emphasis mine)

According to Rick Warren, [**wolf in sheep's clothing**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wolfsheep.html), the spiritual damage created by _disobedience_ (sin) is **only our _fellowship_  with God,** when it is much worse. This is easy to prove since he mentioned _friendship with the world, and other sins._

**QUESTION: How serious is it to be a _friend of this world?_ James 4:4 is clear:**

> You adulterous people, don’t you know that **friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an enemy of God.**

It seems as though that James 4:4 Scripture could be personalized for Rick Warren into this:

> _**[Rick Warren]**_, don’t you know that **friendship with the world is hatred toward God? Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an [enemy of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/enemies-of-God.html).**

To be a _friend of the world_ is to also be _**an enemy of God._** So how bad is that?

> **... raging fire** that will consume the **enemies of God.** (Heb 10:27)

_**Enemies of God**_ will go to **_raging fire,_** that is, as in the _fiery furnace!_ Hence, **what eternal security teacher Rick Warren has taught in his book, _The Purpose Driven Life,_ is not only _wrong_, but much worse, and millions have been exposed to it!**


## Rick Warren Said "and other sins"

Getting back to Rick Warren’s last cited quote, he also said, _and other sins._ That takes in any type of sin, especially since _[**once saved always saved**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesus-es.html)_ people think all sins are of the same degree. Thus, Rick Warren is subtly declaring that **only a Christian’s _fellowship_ is endangered by murder, sodomy, theft, [lust](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lust.html), idolatry, slander, swindling, hate, witchcraft, taking the mark of the beast, etc.** Without question 1 Cor. 6:9,10; Rev. 21:8 and other passages explicitly say such people [**will not inherit God's kingdom**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/will-not-inherit-the-kingdom-of-God.htm) and will be thrown into the lake of fire. That means **Rick Warren is assuring people on the road to damnation (and fiery torment) they are instead on an irrevocable road to heaven (and Paradise)!** The seriousness of that is obvious.

**Both popular Rick Warren and his book, _The Purpose Driven Life,_ are dangerous snares to SOULS by teaching as he does. Remember that and _warn_ others about Rick Warren of _Saddleback Church_.**
