# The Trinity

## Introduction

### If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

![So, If I'm supposed to be God, then am I am sacrficing myself to myself? Or did i just blow your mind!?](../files/pictures/dividingword_intro_1.jpg)

If word has not gotten around yet that I have gone apostate and have denied the Faith, I want to personally give you my testimony concerning the Trinity Doctrine. I realize that even THINKING of indulging such a thought to see if it is true or not is a NO NO among mainstream Christianity. Anyone knows that to touch this subject is like trying to handle a hot potato and risks being ostracize by his peers. Words do not need to be straightforward to realize that there now resides a rift between relationships.

We know that when we come to reveal opposing views of doctrines that have been taught for hundreds of years without question and accepted as the norm, we usually end up with knee-jerk reactions by those who have held to these doctrines they have been taught. The end result is that the person opposing a doctrine taught for so long ends up at the end of a stick, whipped with name calling, loses relationships, and even going so far as to be told they are not Christians but rather a child of the devil and not really saved.

One of the dogmas my eyes were opened to was the false teaching of Original Sin and a lot of others followed such as the false teaching of Once Saved, Always Saved, Substitution, Pre-Trib Rapture, etc.. Now it seems the journey in my life is to investigate this doctrine of the Trinity, a doctrine by main stream Christianity that we dare not question.

I am not saying I have all the answers, but it does leave room for a lot of questions - questions that have bugged me for a long time, but since I have been programed that this topic is not up for discussion, I have always laid the issue aside as a no big deal. But lately, I have been giving it some serious thought.

Some hard questions we must ask ourselves if we hold to the Trinity doctrine:

1. Where in the Bible does it state that if one does not believe in the Trinity, they are not saved?

2. Where in the Bible does it say Jesus is fully human as well as FULLY GOD?

3. Where in Scripture does it say "God the Son?"

4. Since Jesus died on the cross, WHEN DID GOD DIE? Can God die? Not according to Scripture. If Jesus were fully God at the same time being fully human, then the only conclusion is that 1/3 of God died. There is no way around this.

5. If Jesus was fully God, then Jesus had an advantage over us and could not sin because He is God. How does this help me to understand Jesus was tempted in all points as we are when God cannot be tempted?

6. If Jesus is God and and the Holy Spirit is God, why is speaking against Jesus (God) a sin that can be forgiven, but speaking against the Holy Spirit (God) is a sin that can never be forgiven? So in essence, we must really say, If we blaspheme God it is a forgivable sin, but if we blaspheme God is not forgivable.

7. If the Holy Spirit is God and supposedly a person, then why is the Holy Spirit not worshiped? Why is 1/3 of God left out of this equation if the Holy Spirit is God?

I was brought up Catholic and even joined the convent at one time, so when it comes to the doctrine of the Trinity, this is all I have ever known, and in the Protestant world as well - that there are three persons in One God.

Read Rom. 8:15  
The Bible tells us that those who are born again that they have God as their Father.

- If God is a trinity of co-equal persons, then why does only one person become our Father when all three are in relationship with us?

- If "God the Son" and "God the Holy Spirit" our not our Father as well, then what are they in relation to us when we receive the Spirit of adoption?

- If one person became our Father, then should not the other two be our Father as well since they are co-equally our God?

See Mark 13:32. Absolutely no one knows the return of Christ except the Father. It is understandable that Christ would not know, but there is a person missing. What is missing is the co-equal person of the trinity - the Holy Spirit.

- What would be the reason for Jesus leaving him out?

- Is not the Holy Spirit supposed to be equal in knowledge with the Father since we are taught God is omniscient?

- If the Spirit is a distinct co-equal person, why is he not mentioned as knowing the time of Christ's return?

Read 1 Tim. 5:21. Notice here that Paul charged Timothy before (in the presence of) God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels. "God," as in the Father, which is obvious. What did Paul fail to mention? Again, it is the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is left out of the equation.

If the Holy Spirit is indeed a distinct person in the trinity, then why is he not mentioned being in the presence of Paul and Timothy along with the rest of the heavenly hosts? Is he not important as the others?

Read John 17:3. Notice Jesus states that to receive eternal life, we only have to know the Father and the Son. If we believe in the trinity, should we not have a problem because Jesus seems to have forgotten to mention the third co-equal person, the Holy Spirit?

Since the doctrine of the trinity believes that the Spirit is a distinct person, then isn't eternal life by knowing the Holy Spirit as well? Why is it absent from Scripture?

When it comes to the Trinity, it is interesting to see people try to explain what they say is unexplainable and a mystery. When they can't explain it, then how is the person they are teaching able to understand it? Everybody ends up trying to explain something they don't understand and we end up with a lot of people who try to explain what they say is unexplainable! I've been there!

There is more!

"Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone."

It is clear that God cannot be tempted. It would not be up for debate. Now, if God cannot be tempted, how do we explain to others that Jesus is God when Scripture clearly tells us God cannot be tempted and Jesus was tempted?

We end up doing a lot of explaining to get past the clear passages of Scripture concerning this topic.

I will say this, and I have never admitted it to another person except recently. When I would sometimes pray, I would always have in the back of my mind, "Am I praying to Jesus, am I praying to God, am I praying to the Holy Spirit, am I praying to all three, and why pray in Jesus' name if all three are God?

Where it concerns my journey to begin questioning the Trinity, I cannot say that it was any one thing that led me to investigate this issue, but rather it was a culmination of things that I have studied that has brought me to this point. I also saw a clipping that really got my attention. When Jesus said to Peter, "Who do men say that I am? Was Peter's response the following?

> _"Thou are the Logos, existing in the Father as His rationality and then, by an act of His will, being generated, in consideration of the various functions by which God is related to his creation, but only on the fact that Scripture speaks of a Father, and a Son, and a Holy Spirit, each member of the Trinity being coequal with every other member, and each acting inseparably with and interpenetrating every other member, with only an economic subordination within God, but causing no division which would make the substance no longer simple."_

> _And Jesus answering, said, "What?"_

Peter's simple answer was,

> _Thou art Christ, **THE SON** of the living God._

And how did Jesus answer?

> _Jesus answered and said to him, You are blessed, Simon, son of Jonah, **for flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but My Father in Heaven.** Mat 16:17_

Many have accused me of defecting from the faith and someone just recently reminded me that not long ago I was defending the Trinity doctrine. Yes, it is true that I did defend the Trinity doctrine. I also at one time defended the OSAS doctrine, the Pre-trib doctrine, Original sin doctrine, etc.. The same person that accuses me, does he not remember when he defended certain doctrines that were not biblical and made corrections that was necessary?

When God, the Father, reveals truth to us, we cannot turn away from it. Many are content with staying in the "safe zone" rather than search the Scriptures. God never chastises anyone for studying His word. As another brother well stated, "Our past statements should not influence our acceptance of current light or truth." So I'm sure none of us, when we have been given further light, would want our past beliefs held against us. It's not easy eating humble pie when we realize we have been in error and must correct it.

One of the things I have noticed is that not one of the questions above is addressed.

I might add this. James says,

> _...you believe that GOD IS ONE you do well; the demons also believe, and shudder._

This might sound offensive, but it's a shame that the demons know who Jesus is more than us Christians.

There is not one single instance of the many recorded examples of Jesus' casting out of demons where the demons ever even hinted that he is God. Not one. They addressed Jesus as:

The Holy One of God  
The Son of God  
The Son of the Most High God  
The Messiah (Christ)  
The Son of God Most High

It is true we don't get our truth from demons, but what they said it truth. Like James says, "You believe that GOD IS ONE you do well; the demons also believe, and shudder."

Even demons believe God is one.

Calling Jesus "Messiah," "Lord Messiah," "the Lord Jesus," "the Lord Jesus Christ," or "our Lord Jesus Christ" was a common practice among the early believers.

However, calling Jesus "the Lord God," "the Lord our God," or "the Almighty" are Biblical titles exclusively for the Father OF Jesus and were never practiced by the early believers in reference to Jesus.

Jesus was never referred to as _"God the Son."_

When I came upon knowing the teaching of Original sin was false, I knew in my spirit it was correct. When I tried to share this with my friends, they shunned me and called me all kinds of names. I was not yet well equipped to answer all their objections and it took me about two years of study this issue because of the centuries of what has been taught and taken for granted. It is the same with this teaching. As I said above, I don't have all the answers, and doubt if I ever will, but I trust the Holy Spirit will guide me. I will share things as I go along in this study. What I don't need is for someone to spam me or try and convince me the Trinity is Biblical since I have already been there and know all about the teaching of this doctrine. Remember, I once defended it.

But what I also want to say is this - that if you become awakened from your drugged state of this awful doctrine, it will cost you. You are coming against a monster that is accepted by mainstream Christianity all over the world that has accepted a teaching that came about 300 to 400 years AFTER Christ. You will find your questions are totally ignored, but yet you are expected to answer theirs.

Hundreds of years ago believers suffered death because they held to the words and teachings of Christ and the apostles. John Calvin had Michael Servetus killed (among others) because Servetus did not subscribed to the teaching of the Trinity. Instead of killing today, the best they can do now is attack your character, say all kinds of evil against you; anything to try and silence you. Like with any of God's truth, it burns within hearts and can't keep quiet.


## Keep in Mind

I am going to start you off with something to keep in mind, and that is to remember there is a difference between Jesus (Yeshua) and God (Yahweh).

![PICTURE](../files/pictures/dividingword_intro_2.jpg)

Listen to Peter in answer to Jesus' question:

> _"He [Jesus] said to them, But who do you say I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, **You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.** Jesus answered and said to him, You are blessed, Simon, son of Jonah, for flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but My Father in Heaven."_

As with Peter, this is a revelation recently given to me as well from God the Father concerning His Son. The only way I can describe it is that the light bulb did not give off any light until I saw the light. As long as I was defending and believing in the Trinity doctrine, that revelation was hidden from me. God the Father will not talk until we are ready to listen. As I said before, this is new for me and I am not yet well equipped to answer all the objections. All I can do is study and lean on the holy Spirit to guide me into all truth as promised he will do. God will also give us teachers to help guide us for he gives us teachers (Eph. 4:11) to help us, but as with any teacher, we must test it against the word of God. A teacher can teach, but God will give the revelation within your spirit when truth is taught.

Remember, Peter said to Jesus (Yeshua) "**You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,"** not God (Yahweh). This is the simple truth and you can believe it's true, but until it's **revealed** to you, then you will know the difference! Jesus said, "You are blessed, Simon, son of Jonah,<u>**for flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but My Father in Heaven.**</u>

Yes, it's understandable that probably a whole number of verses are flying through your mind at the moment, just as it did mine, because most of the readers, as I, have been taught nothing but the Trinity doctrine. But please read Peter's response again above. Jesus (Yeshua) is called the **"...the Christ, the Son of the living God."**


## Monotheistic Tradition

> **"If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do? (Ps. 11:3)**

The saints of the Old Covenant were <u>strictly monotheistic</u>. The monotheistic tradition continued and Jesus did not change it.

Jesus, **our Apostle,** had only one creed about God our Father and I would rather appeal to his creed than the Athanasian creed which says in a nutshell,

> _"Whoever wants to be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic [universal] faith; which faith unless everyone keeps it whole and undefiled, without doubt he will perish everlastingly. And the catholic faith is this: that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance The Father eternal, the Son eternal and the Holy Spirit eternal, and they are not three eternals but one eternal So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty. And yet they are not three almighties, but one almighty. So the Father is God, the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is God. And yet they are not three Gods, but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord and the Holy Spirit Lord; and yet they are not three Lords but one Lord. For just as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord, so we are forbidden by the catholic religion to say there are three Gods or three Lords .And in this Trinity none is before or after another; none is greater or less than another. But the whole three persons are coeternal and coequal. So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped. He who wants to be saved must thus think of the Trinity."_

I cannot see Jesus subscribing to this creed or the Nicene creed, but only that creed which has been taught throughout Scripture. He, too, would come under the cruel anathemas of this "Christian" creed, just as others.

Jesus affirmed the creed of Israel, that there is only **one God**. The Old Testament is strictly monotheistic. God is a single personal being.

> _**"Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one God."**_

Even Paul, a Jew of all Jews, says,

> _There is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Messiah Jesus (1.Tim. 2:5)_

But that is not enough for Christianity.

Are we obeying Jesus' commandments? Jesus has a right to tell us who God is and we should not ignore Jesus' understanding of monotheism. Jesus never demonstrated a new creed of defining who God is. We must appeal to the creed of Jesus (Yeshua), concerning the **"first commandment,"**

> _Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one. (Mark 12:29)_

John 17:3 records Jesus' own strict monotheism. He declared that,

> _You, Father, are the only one who is truly God._

Jesus never taught that he is God. Are we going to believe what Jesus said? Instead of believing what Jesus taught so we can all speak the same thing (1 Cor. 1:10), it has led to years of confusion, conflict, and a war on words because we have read Scriptures through the filter of the Trinity teaching that was not taught at the time of Christ, but came 300-400 years later.

We must go back to **Monotheistic Tradition** as taught throughout Scripture. I don't know about  you, but I would rather put my faith in the words of God as my foundation rather than on Statements of Faith based on creeds formed centuries later.

Jesus (Yeshua) is not God (Yahweh). Listen to what Jesus says VERY carefully,

> _"And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent."_

This is the SON OF GOD praying to HIS FATHER. These are the words of Jesus himself. Dare we not agree with him? Man has to come up with a lot of philosophical explanations, pictures, and have us do a lot of mindless gymnastics as they try to explain the Trinity in order for us to have some kind of understanding about it. And if we don't understand it, just accept it "by faith," so we are told. But God forbid if you reject it!

So far the words of Peter and Jesus are so simple. Jesus (Yeshua) did not do away with the **Monotheistic doctrine** and change it into a  **Trinitarian doctrine.**

Let's heed Paul's warning:

> _If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ AND the teaching that accords with godliness, he has an over-high opinion of himself; being without knowledge, having only an unhealthy love of questionings and wars of words, from which come envy, fighting, cruel words, evil thoughts. (1 Tim. 6:3)_

I encourage that we search the Scriptures for ourselves rather than run to just about every commentary that interprets Scripture through the filter of the Trinity doctrine. As someone who aptly stated:

> _"It is better to be divided by truth than to be united in error. It is better to speak the truth that hurts, and then heals, than falsehood that comforts, then kills. It is not love, and it is not friendship, if we fail do declare the whole counsel of God. It is better to be hated for telling the truth than to be loved for telling a lie. It is impossible to find anyone in the Bible who was a power for God who did not have enemies and was not hated. It's better to stand alone with the truth than to be wrong with a multitude. It is better ultimately to succeed with truth than to temporarily succeed with a lie."_

Rely on the Holy Spirit who will guide us into all truth.

> _"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you." (John 14:26)_
