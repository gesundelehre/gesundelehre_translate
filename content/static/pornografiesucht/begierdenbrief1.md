> I read your message **[_Hell and Who Goes There_](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html)** and it is the message that I have been searching for lately to turn from the [**sin**](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html) that I keep going back to constantly. I am a 21 year old college student and I was saved when I was 17 years old.
> 
> Since the early part of this summer, I have made a mental challenge for myself to pray to God everytime I think about him, which is a lot of my time, especially when I am driving somewhere or walking to class. I have also attempted a challenge for myself to read at least a chapter a day out of the bible.
> 
> I have this major sin in my life ([**pornography**](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/pornography.htm)), which was introduced to me at the age of 13\. I plead with God to keep me from going back to it, but it feels like my faith is not strong enough. I need your prayers and insight on how to grow more to Christ and away from this perversion.
> 
> I feel that your message is a seed of hope, which I pray will pull me through this ordeal in my life.

> Sincerely,

**Evangelical Outreach's Response:**

 Greetings to you in the precious, liberating name of the Lord Jesus! Thank you for your letter. Sorry it took us a little while to get back with you.

Jesus taught more on **[Hell](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/salvtion.htm)** than He did on **[Heaven](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/salvtion.htm#heaven)**, but we rarely hear about this very literal place, where we as Christians can still potentially end up (Mt. 10:28).

D., the key for you as a young man is thus:

> "How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word. I seek you with all my heart; do not let me stray from your commands. I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (Psa. 119:9-11).

It is absolutely imperative for you to spend good, quality time in the Bible for yourself EVERY DAY, at LEAST 15 minutes. You will probably need to spend more time than this since reading a chapter a day is not helping you much. Let me recommend at least three chapters every day from the New Testament. You should also spend quality time memorizing and meditating in the Scriptures. [Please listen to our audio sermon entitled, "[**The How and Why of Memorizing Scripture**](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sermons.html)".] You will find that the draw for sin will quickly become diminished as your thinking becomes centered on God's eternal truth. The Bible is your contract book with the Almighty God. Your eternal destiny hinges on what you do with this message. It couldn't be more serious!

It would also be good to wash out your mind the same way before you go to sleep at night. You need to flood your mind with God's truth, hide His word in your heart, wash your mind out, especially as a college student since you are forced to think constantly about this world system and philosophical issues. Not only that, but the temptations for you are much greater in college than they perhaps would be in another setting.

It's not only what you put into your mind and heart that will affect your behavior, but it's what you don't put in. Consequently, you should immediately cut out all sources that would tend to generate lust. This means stop watching [**TV**](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/tv.htm). We stopped watching this vile tool of the devil years ago and it has been an incredible blessing. Also immediately burn any and all pornographic literature that you have! Do not give the devil a foothold in your life through any form of lust, especially since the Tempter has been so successful with this in the past. You are in a very intense, spiritual warfare. The only way you will overcome is with good, that is, by using spiritual weapons as you fight against the devil's subtle and clever temptations. Sometimes he waits for the most opportune time to try to snare you, so be on your guard always. You are battling for eternity.

D., whom the Son sets free is free indeed (Jn. 8:36). We say this to you as gently but truthfully as we know how: You may very well have been saved when you were 17, but if you are enslaved to pornographic lust, you are not on your way to heaven at this point. Jesus taught that lusting in the heart was the very same as committing the actual act (Mt. 5:28). Of course, complete delivery and freedom from all sinful bondage is available for you regardless of how many times the devil has snared you with this particular type of sin. Please see our article about Jesus' teaching on **[lust](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lust.html)**.

Keep yourself from spiritual pollutants (Jam. 1:27).

Following Jesus
