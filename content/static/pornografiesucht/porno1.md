## Sure Help For Those Addicted To Pornography

> **[Email]** I am struggling with pornography. I have visited your site many times and you have mailed me some material. Please pray for me.... Thanks. [name withheld]

**[[Bible Answer](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible-answers.html)**] Greetings in Jesus' holy name.

Thank you for your openness regarding pornography. Please know there is an answer for EVERY spiritual problem in the Holy Bible; pornography is no exception. On the other hand, please know that just being exposed to the truth that will change your life is NOT enough to do so! There must be action too. James put it this way, "Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says" (James 1:22). Read the next three verses to see what else he wrote on this subject.

So, for you to overcome this **[sin](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html)** you are going to have to CHANGE some things! If you don't change, you will continue as you are now [and remain on the road to hell]. You MUST be willing to establish new habits (godly ones)and break old ones (ungodly ones). With the help of God you can do it.

Your **[thought](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/our-thought-life.html)** life is vitally important. You need to feed off of wholesome thoughts (the word of God) and cut out of your life destructive, soul-damning, poisonous thoughts and imaginations, such as generated by pornography. A person's thought life is vitally important! So when the Tempter (the devil) gives you a thought or imagination that will tend to generate lust and [**mental adultery**](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lust.html), fight against it!!! Paul stated that we are to "cast down imaginations" (2 Cor. 10:5, KJV). The NIV states in the same verse that we are to "take captive every thought"!

## How You Can Successfully Overcome Pornography

(1) You MUST wash out your mind with God's word. You need to spend as much time as you can in the Bible, reading it, memorizing certain verses and pondering these eternal truths throughout the day. Victory or defeat will be connected with this point! For some, a couple hours a day will be needed to keep the filth out of the mind. It will become easier the longer you do this. Get a good, easy to read translation like the New International Version and learn the New Testament for yourself. Also, buy the New Testament on cassette tape, so you can listen to it at various times throughout the day. A great time to listen to the Bible on cassette tape is when you go to bed at night. Listening to the word of God will not only feed you spiritually, but prevent lustful thoughts and imaginations from coming into your mind.

(2) Destroy your pornography. Tear it up and burn it! Trash belongs in the trash pile so get rid of it. Also, don't go places where the devil will especially be able to tempt you. This means that places like the beach, public swimming pools, etc. must be avoided. The Bible says: "Do not give the devil a foothold" (Eph. 4:27).

(3) **[Pray](http://www.gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/prayer.html)** throughout the day, asking God for His help and deliverance. Remember, God is real and He is ALMIGHTY. NOTHING is hard for Him. Humble yourself before Him and ask for His help as you follow what He has already given us in the Holy Bible.

(4) There is VICTORY IN JESUS. VICTORY for [Name] will come, as it will for any person, if you go by the rules for victory.

Please read Rom. 13:14\. Keep yourself pure (1 Tim. 5:22).

GOD BLESS YOU.

Following The Lord Jesus,
