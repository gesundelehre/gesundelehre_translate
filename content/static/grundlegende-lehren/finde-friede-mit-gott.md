## YOU Can Find _Peace With God_ Through Jesus Christ

**To _find peace with God_ and maintain that peace with God should be our chief pursuit. Someone might object and say our chief pursuit in life should be to keep seeking _first_ the kingdom of God and his righteousness (Mt. 6:33, Greek tense). Actually each is saying the same, but in different words.** 

[![find peace with God](../files/pictures/peace-with-god.jpg "find peace with God")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)

Many people are not even aware that they don’t have _peace_ with God and, therefore, would never desire to _seek/pursue_ such. Furthermore, the same don’t realize that **God has wrath for those who do wrong. Here are some precious truths about _peace_ with God to remember:**



## _Peace With God_ Verses

> Therefore, since we have been justified through faith, we have **peace with God** through our Lord Jesus Christ (Rom. 5:1).

> For God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him, and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, by making **peace through his blood, shed on the cross** (Col. 1:19, 20).

<big>**[Everyone Should Know About Putting Forth EFFORT For _PEACE WITH GOD_](#find%20peace%20with%20God)**</big>

At the point of being Biblically justified we have _peace with God._ This is also when our heavy sin load is forgiven, we are cleansed spiritually and are _born again_. All of that was made possible because of **Jesus’ _blood_ shed on the cross.** But now, for the Christian, the question remains: **Is it possible for events to occur _after_ getting saved that would destroy or at least interfere with this precious _peace_ with God?** The answer is a definite **_yes._** It is _sin_ that always causes trouble between us and God and that can severely damage and even destroy our precious _peace_ with God. Notice what Peter wrote:

> For, whoever would love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from deceitful speech. He must turn from evil and do good; he must **seek peace** and **pursue it**. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayer, but **the face of the Lord is against those who do evil** (1 Pet. 3:10-12).

Peter said we should **_pursue_ peace** (with God). It is significant that he wrote that to people who have already been _redeemed_ and _born again_ (1:18-23). Paul, similarly, taught we should also _pursue peace_ (with God) among other things:

> Flee the evil desires of youth, and **pursue** righteousness, faith, love and **peace**, along with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart (2 Tim. 2:22).

## MAKE EVERY EFFORT To Find _Peace With God_

Certainly, a passage that infers **we can lose our _peace_ with God after getting saved** is found here. (It was written to those who had already been saved):

> So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, **make every effort to be found** spotless, blameless and **at peace with him** (2 Pet. 3:14).

This verse also shows that **a Christian’s future sins are _not_ automatically forgiven** (as Charles Stanley and some others teach), for if they were there would be no chance that we could not have _peace_ with God (which sin destroys). The **[Christian life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-life.html)** is a spiritual battle that requires serious _effort_ on our part. _Grace_ doesn’t change this. We are to make it our goal to be found by the Lord in a _spotless_ and _blameless_ condition, as well as, at _peace_ with him. This is what was taught and magnified in first-century Christianity, even though it is ignored and even rejected in our day. To have peace with God can be associated with having a _clear conscience._ Notice what Paul revealed about his own personal Christian life:

> There will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. So **I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man** (Acts 24:15,16).

Paul put forth serious effort to keep _a clear conscience_. If he sought for such, we should too. Notice the following:

> I am afraid that when I come again my God may humiliate me before you, and I may mourn over**many of those who have sinned** in the past and **not repented of the [impurity, immorality and sensuality which they have practiced](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/practice-sin.htm)** (2 Cor. 12:21, NASB).

**This passage proves, among other things, that real Christians can afterwards turn from the Lord and start to _practice_ sin again, something the _[never saved to begin with](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm)_ grace changing [eternal security teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html) deny. Also, when we join that stirring truth to the following one from this same epistle, we can easily see that sin destroys**  our _peace_ with God and creates the need for us to be _reconciled to God:_

> We are therefore Christ’s ambassadors, as though God were making his appeal through us. We implore you on Christ’s behalf: **Be reconciled to God** (2 Cor. 5:20).

NOTE: **Unsaved people need to be reconciled with God** (2 Cor. 5:18). That is also shown here:

<big>**[How Does View The Unsaved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/unsaved-people.htm)**</big>

But now **he has reconciled you by Christ’s physical body** through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation—<u>**if**</u> **you continue in your faith**, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. **This is the gospel** that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant (Col. 1:22, 23).

**Question: Do _you_ have _peace_ with God _now?_ If not, you can _find peace with God_ by turning from your sins that are robbing you of this (and dragging you to [hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html) at the same time). Make things right before God and man. Remember: _No sin_ is worth going to hell over regardless what it may be. Now that you know how to _find peace with God_ do it!**
