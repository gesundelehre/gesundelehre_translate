## The Unvarnished Truth About The _Christian Life_

[![christian life](../../files/pictures/difficult-road-to-life.jpg "The christian life is a BATTLE.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)

**Das _CHRISTLICHE LEBEN_ ist ein intensiver Kampf gegen _Sünde_ (Heb. 12,4).** Das Böse versucht uns im christlichen Leben zu überwinden, aber wir können es durch das _Gute_ überwinden (Röm. 12,21). The devil is trying to deceive us, so we must be alert and self-controlled (1 Peter 5:8). We must be an overcomer in the end to inherit God’s kingdom and escape the lake of fire (Rev. 21:1-8). We might have to shed our blood (Heb. 12:4) and die a martyr to _overcome_ (Rev. 12:11). If we disown Jesus, he’ll disown us (Mt. 10:33). It is possible after being set free from sin by Jesus' blood to _again_ get entangled in sin and be overcome by it (2 Pet. 2:20; 1 Tim. 5:11). Our current spiritual battle in the Christian life is for spiritual _life or death_ itself (Rom. 8:13; James 5:19,20; Lk. 15:24; etc.). We are told to put forth _every effort_ to enter the narrow door, for _many_ will try to enter but will not be able to (Lk. 13:24), and put forth _every effort_ to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with God (2 Pet. 3:14). That is a partial summary of the _Christian life_, but there is much more to know!

## Dangers and Casualties In The _Christian Life_

[![christian life](../../files/pictures/he-will-forsake-you.jpg "God might forsake us in the christian life.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lose-salvation.html)

<big><big>**[Watch Out For This Common Snare](#christian%20life)**</big></big>

There will be many _deceived_ by false prophets (Mt. 24:11). Many will _turn away_ from the truth (2 Tim. 4:3,4). Many will be _deceived_ by **[false teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm)** declaring heresies (2 Pet. 2:1,2). People will be _deceived_ by satanic miracles (Rev. 19:20; 2 Thess. 2:9-12). We are to _add to our faith_ various virtues to make our calling and election sure (2 Pet. 1:5-10). We must continue in God’s kindness or we will be _cut off_ from spiritual life (Rom. 11:20-22). We must _continue_ in the teaching of Jesus to have God (2 Jn. 9). We must _persevere_ under trial to receive the **[crown of life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/crown.html)** (James 1:12). We must bring forth good fruit or we’ll be cut down and thrown _in the fire_ (Jn. 15:1-6; Lk. 13:6-9). The _lukewarm_ will be spued out of Jesus’ body (Rev. 3:15,16). Only a _few_ (the minority) at Sardis didn’t soil their spiritual clothes and were still _worthy_ to walk with Jesus (Rev. 3:4,5). It is our personal responsibility—not God’s—to _keep_ our lamps burning (Lk. 12:35), _keep_ ourselves pure (1 Tim. 5:22), _keep_ ourselves from idols (1 Jn. 5:21) and _keep_ ourselves from the spiritual pollutants of this world (James 1:26,27). It is possible to _quickly_ turn away from God (1 Tim. 5:15; Gal. 1:6), _return_ to sin and _go back_ as a dog to his vomit or a washed sow to the mud again (2 Pet. 2:22). We must _keep **[God's word](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wordgod.html)**_ not to die spiritually (Jn. 8:51).

[![COPYRIGHT. christian life](../../files/pictures/narrowpath.jpg "The real Christian life is traveling the hard road (Mt. 7:14).")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/getsaved.html)

Jesus gives **[eternal salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/getsaved.html)** only for those who _obey_ him (Heb. 5:9). Only those who do God’s will shall enter God’s kingdom (Mt. 7:21). We have to put into practice God’s word to be the Lord’s spiritual family (Lk. 8:21). If we forsake God, he will forsake us (2 Chron. 15:2). After initial salvation we are to be afraid of God, who can destroy both our body and soul in hell (Mt. 10:28; Lk. 12:4,5). It is _hard_ for the **[righteous](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/righteous.html)** to be saved (1 Pet. 4:18; Mt. 7:14). Even the apostle **[Judas Iscariot](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/judas.html)** lost his _salvation_ (Mt. 10:1-4 cf. Mk. 14:21; Jn. 17:12) and the Lord’s original disciples, who were trying to be the greatest in the kingdom, would have to _change_ to enter the kingdom of heaven (Mt. 18:1-3).


## <a name="christian%20life"></a>A Common Snare In The _Christian Life_

**To think you are standing firm is to be set up for a spiritual _fall_ (1 Cor. 10:12) and to be _arrogant_ (Rom. 11:20). Since God didn't spare the natural branches, but cut them off because of unbelief, he will NOT spare YOU either (Rom.11:21)!** God opposes the arrogant (1 Pet. 5:5). Without _holiness and a pure heart_ at death, no one will see God (Heb. 12:14; Mt. 5:8; Rev. 20:6). We have to persist in _doing good_ to get eternal life (Rom. 2:6-8) and sow to please the Spirit of God to reap eternal life (Gal. 6:8,9).

Bad company _corrupts_ good character (1 Cor. 15:33), so we must be careful with our friends and who teaches us. We need to _avoid_ every kind of evil (1 Thess. 5:22) and that includes certain people, places and things. It’s possible to believe in vain (1 Cor. 15:2), cease believing (Lk. 8:13) and have our faith shipwrecked and destroyed (1 Tim. 1:19; 2 Tim. 2:18). We can also _fall away_ (Heb. 6:6; Lk. 8:13) and no longer be _known_ by Jesus after we had a burning spiritual lamp (Mt. 25:12). If we take words away from God’s book of prophecy, he will _take_ our share of the holy city away from us (Rev. 22:19). _Loving God_ is a salvation issue (James 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:9), which is the same as _obeying_ God (Jn. 14:15, 21,23). Being _faithful_ to God (Rev. 2:10,11) is also a salvation issue.

## Christian Life Lessons Reveal More Dangers and Cautions

God will _take_ our talent back if we do not bring forth gain (Mt. 25:28) and have us cast into outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth (Mt. 25:30), which is a description of the _fiery furnace_ (Mt. 13:41,42; 13:49,50; 8:12) and not a place in heaven like the heretical **[eternal security teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html)** want us to believe. If we don’t **[forgive others](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/forgive.html)** who **[sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html)** against us, _we will not be forgiven_ (Mt. 6:14,15; 18:34,35). We must follow Jesus to have the _light of life_ (Jn. 8:12). If we defile our bodily temple, God will _destroy_ us (1 Cor. 3:17). If we become a friend of this world we also become God’s _enemy_ (James 4:4), and _raging fire_ will consume God’s enemies (Heb. 10:27). We must come out from the world and be _separate_ to be received by God (2 Cor. 6:14-17). That is basic to the Christian life, but there is more! We must endure _to the end_ through persecutions to be _saved_ (Mt. 10:22). We can have the Spirit of God leave us (1 Sam. 16:14; Heb. 3:6). We are told to _hold on_ to what we have so that no one will take our crown (Rev. 3:11), and _hold to_ our courage and the hope which we profess (Heb. 3:6). The cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice **[magic arts](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/occult.html)**, the idolaters and all liars—their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur (Rev 21:8). For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a man is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. (Eph 5:5) The unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God, that is, the fornicators, idolaters, adulterers, effeminate, homosexuals, thieves, covetous, **[drunkards](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/drunk.html)**, revilers and swindlers will not inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:9,10). Even hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions, envy, drunkenness, orgies and the like can cause one not to inherit the kingdom of God (Gal 5:19-21). The true Christian life is a holy life, set apart for God.

To think we can sow to please the flesh and reap eternal life is an indirect evil attempt to _mock God_ and to be _deceived_ (Gal. 6:7-9). The **[devil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html)** is not in **[hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html)** now, but is trying to _devour_ us (1 Pet. 5:8,9), and we must _resist_ him to have him _flee_ (James 4:7). We must put on the _whole armor_ of **[God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.html)** to stand against the devil (Eph. 6:11).There are _no secret sins,_ motives or thoughts before God (Heb. 4:13). It has always been impossible to sin and get away with it, even for the angels (2 Pet. 2:4-9). It is better to cut your hand or foot off and gouge your eye out than for sin to drag you into eternal hell fire (Mk. 9:43-48). It is righteousness which delivers from **[spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)** (Prov. 10:2; 11:4), and the righteous are those who _do what is right_ (1 Jn. 3:7). Those who do what is sinful are _from the devil_ (1 Jn. 3:8). (Too few know that about the Christian life.) We know that we have come to know him if we _**[obey](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/obey.html)**_ his commands (1 John 2:3). The man who says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is _not_ in him (1 John 2:4). The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for **[eternal life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternallife.html)**. (John 12:25) We can develop a sinful and unbelieving heart which _turns away_ from God (Heb. 3:12). To share in Christ, we must hold firm _till the end_ the confidence we had at first (Heb. 3:14). To continue to remain in _the Son,_ we will have to see to it that what we have heard from the beginning remains in us (1 Jn. 2:24,25) According to true grace teaching, eternal life is also a _hope_ (Titus 3:7), _yet to be reaped_ (Gal. 6:8,9), in _the age to come_ (Mk. 10:30) for only those who _persist in doing good_ (Rom. 2:7), and _do not grow weary and give up_ (Gal. 6:9). The most righteous man on earth in his day was **[Job](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/job.htm)** and he was _blameless, upright, feared the Lord and shunned evil_ (Job 1:8). You can live godly too! God esteems: him who is humble and contrite in spirit, and trembles at his word (Isa 66:2). **The aforementioned truths about the _Christian life_ are too little known in our dark day.**
