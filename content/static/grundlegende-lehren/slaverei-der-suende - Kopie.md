## A Backslider Can Return To Jesus and Salvation

[![backsliders return to Jesus salvation no eternal security](../../files/pictures/return-to-Jesus-no-eternal-security.jpg "The backslider can return to Jesus and salvation")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)

**Certainly one of the powerfully devastating passages to eternal security is the last two verses in the book of James. They show the righteous can die spiritually (and return to Jesus again for salvation). Sadly, too few people are aware of these verses and those who are probably first noticed them in their own personal Bible reading time and never heard them taught.** Here is what these important verses say:

My brethren, if any among you <u>strays from the truth</u> and one turns him back, let him know that he who turns <u>a sinner</u> from the error of his way will <u>save his soul from death</u> and will <u>cover a multitude of sins</u> (James 5:19,20, NASB).

This passage mentions the possibility of _brethren_ straying from the truth (or **[backsliding](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/backslider.html)**) and what the effects of that action will be on their _souls_. First, we know the ones backsliding were previously Christians. There are various ways we know this:

<span class="inline-images">
![return to salvation get saved again](../../files/pictures/redball.gif "Backsliders can return to Jesus and salvation") They are called _brethren_ in v. 19 which is further explained in James 2:1 where the same are identified as _believers_ in the Lord Jesus.
</span>

<span class="inline-images">
![get saved again](../../files/pictures/redball.gif "Return to Jesus and salvation")If the ones (the Christians) who stray are brought back to where they were before they strayed (or backslid), their _souls_ would be saved from death. This is crystal clear proof that he is writing about this horrible thing occurring to those **who had been genuinely saved**.
</span>

<span class="inline-images">
![get saved again](../../files/pictures/redball.gif "Backsliders can get saved again")They would also stray from _truth._ Jesus identified himself by that term—_the truth_ (John 14:6). Hence, they would be straying from the Lord, Christianity and their own salvation.
</span>

<big><big>**[PROOF That a Backslider Can Return To Jesus and Salvation](#return to Jesus)**</big></big> 

James then mentions another person turning the one who strayed from the truth back (to where he was before he strayed). He wanted that person to know he would be turning a _sinner_ around. NOTE: **The spiritual identity of the Christian would change to _sinner_ under such circumstances.** A _sinner_ is an _unsaved person_ who has his _soul_ in jeopardy of eternal death. A **[Christian is not a sinner](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christiansinner.htm)**.

That former Christian, who became a _sinner_ by his straying from the truth and committing sin would be reinstatedto salvation by his turning back (**[repenting](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)**). His _soul_, which was in jeopardy of eternal death, would no longer be in such danger and the multitude of sins that he committed when he backslid would be covered (forgiven).


## More _Return To Jesus_ Observations

Note these important observations relevant to the believer’s security. Please observe:<span> 

a) **Straying from the truth into a multitude of sins is a definite possibility (and not just hypothetical) for the real Christian. Hence, this passage, as well as others, destroys the argument that if one turns to wickedness _he was never really saved to begin with._ James is writing about real Christians straying to their spiritual death and being brought back to the _truth_ (and salvation) again by another.**

b) **The Christian who strayed did not have his future sins already forgiven before they were committed.** We know this because they produced spiritual death.

c) It doesn’t say here that such people who stray from the truth merely lose their rewards, fellowship with God, **[assurance of salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/assuranc.html)**, position in the kingdom, etc. as the eternal security teachers, such as **[Charles Stanley](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-stanley.html)**, **[Dave Hunt](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/davehunt.htm)** and others, teach. It says that his very _soul_ becomes dead spiritually, as James stated earlier would occur:

But each one is tempted when he is carried away and enticed by his own lust. Then when lust has conceived, it gives birth to **sin**; and **when sin is accomplished, it brings forth death. Do not be deceived**, my beloved brethren (NASB).

d)**<a name="return to Jesus"></a> A person can get saved _again,_** just like the prodigal did (Lk. 15:24,32). See also Romans 11:19-23. [Heb. 6:4-6 is the exception to this and not the norm. In Hebrews, the ones who couldn’t be renewed again by repentance (or saved again) sinned in such an extreme way they couldn’t find forgiveness. In other words, they committed _eternal sin_, which was necessary for them to return to the synagogue and was also the pressure they faced.]

e) No one would have to _pluck_ such a person who strays out of the Father’s hand. _Sin_ would bring about **[spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)**, as it always has. See Ezek. 33:18; 18:24; etc.


f) **We too can be used by God to bring a former Christian back to salvation again. In our day, this will happen after we learn [eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) is not true, but instead _a deadly lie._ Until this is known, and acted upon, it will be impossible to go after the backslider _to save his soul from death,_ as  taught by James.**

(Please, please pass this important message from James 5:19,20 on to your family, friends and contacts. **Precious souls could be rescued from the furnace of fire by doing so. Are you willing to do this simple thing to help backsliders return to Jesus?)**
