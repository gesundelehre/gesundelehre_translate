## Christian Head Coverings

![christian head coverings](../../files/pictures/mennonite-head-covering.jpg "A piece of cloth on a woman's head is NOT the head covering.")

**What is the Biblical _head covering?_** There are various religious groups that exalt **a piece of cloth of a certain _color,_ cut to a certain _size_ and _shape_ and _worn in a certain manner_ (according to their church laws and traditions) as the _head covering_ of Scriptures.** Their _head covering_ is also often among theirchief _doctrinal distinctives_ and is exalted to a **_salvation_** issue in some groups for the female members. 

![christian head coverings](../../files/pictures/head-covering-black.jpg "There are NO scriptures which support a piece of cloth as the head covering!")

At other times, the _head covering_ isn’t quite exalted to that degree but seems to come close to it. Hence, **because their interpretation of the _head covering_ is elevated to this degree**, it becomes a _primary_ issue. QUESTION: Must a **[Christian](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html)** woman, after hearing teachings on why the head covering is supposed to be a piece of cloth, wear such for _salvation_ and/or _close fellowship_ with the saints, according to the **[Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)**?

It is the purpose of this study to Biblically examine the details around _Christian head coverings_. For the God fearing Christian, we must remember **_not_** to go **_beyond what is written in Scripture_** (1 Cor. 4:6). Moreover, a Christian is **_thoroughly equipped_** with the Scriptures **_alone_** (2 Tim. 3:16,17). [Hence, he does **_not_** need the writings of any so-called “ church fathers” or church elders, etc.] With this in mind, let’s proceed carefully to see what **[God's word](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wordgod.html)**, final spiritual authority, says.

## Head Coverings for Christian Women, According To The Bible

![headcovering for christian women](../../files/pictures/headcovering-for-christian-women.jpg "The headcovering for christian women is NOT a piece of cloth.")

The** _only_** time in the Bible the Christian _head covering_ is referred to is in 1 Corinthians 11\. To get the whole context about the _head covering_, we must examine more than just one or two verses. Paul wrote:

> Now I want you to realize that **the head of every man is Christ, and the head of the woman is man**, and the head of Christ is **[God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.html)**. (1 Cor 11:3) Every man who **prays or prophesies with his head covered** dishonors his head. (1 Cor 11:4) And every woman who **prays or prophesies with her head uncovered** dishonors her head—it is just as though her head were shaved. (1 Cor 11:5)

### COMMENTS About The Biblical Head Covering

● Both Christian men and Christian women are to _pray and prophesy,_ but this is to be done in the right way or their _head_ will be _dishonored_. For the man to do this he must have his head **_uncovered._** If not, he will dishonor his head—the Lord Jesus. The opposite is true for the woman _when praying or prophesying._ If her head is _uncovered_ (no _head covering_), she will dishonor her husband.

● If a Christian woman prays or prophesies with her head uncovered (no _head covering_) it is the equivalent to her head being _shaven_.

> Will sie sich nicht bedecken, so schneide man ihr auch das Haar ab. **Nun es aber übel stehet, daß ein Weib verschnitten Haar habe oder beschoren sei**, so lasset sie das Haupt bedecken. (1.Kor 11,6; Luther 1545)

● For a Christian woman to have her hair shaved off is a _disgrace_ to her personally. Hence, if a Christian woman does not _cover_ her head (have a _head covering_) when praying and prophesying she dishonors her husband and disgraces herself.

> **Der Mann aber soll das Haupt nicht bedecken**, sintemal er ist Gottes Bild und Ehre; das Weib aber ist des Mannes Ehre. (1 Kor 11:7) Denn der Mann ist nicht vom Weibe, sondern das Weib ist vom Manne. (1 Kor 11:8) Und der Mann ist nicht geschaffen um des Weibes willen; sondern das Weib um des Mannes willen. (1 Kor 11:9) Darum soll das Weib **eine Macht auf dem Haupt** haben um der [**Engel**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/angels.html) willen. (1.Kor 11,10; Luther 1545) [Statt Macht übersetzen andere auch "ein Zeichen der Macht/Gewalt", sintemal = weil/da]

● Why Paul gave the aforementioned directives about how Christian women are to pray and prophesy is given—a woman is the glory of man, she was created for man and because of the angels.  Paul also mentioned the woman’s _head covering_ is also _**a sign of authority._**

> Doch ist im Herrn weder das Weib ohne den Mann, noch der Mann ohne das Weib. (1. Kor 11,11) Denn gleichwie das Weib vom Manne [kommt] , so auch der Mann durch das Weib; aber das alles von Gott. (1.Kor 11,12; Schlachterbibel 1951)


## The Identity of the _Head Covering_ is Revealed as LONG HAIR

![long hair head covering](../../files/pictures/hair-head-covering.jpg "LONG HAIR is the head covering for women.")

You are now about to read, in the _clearest_ possible terms, what the woman’s _head covering_ was in first-century Christianity:

> Richtet bei euch selbst, ob es wohl steht, dass ein Weib unbedeckt vor Gott **bete**. (1.Kor 11,13) Oder lehrt euch auch nicht die Natur, dass es einem Manne eine Unehre ist, so er **das Haar lang wachsen** lässt, (1.Kor 11,14) und **dem Weibe eine Ehre, so sie langes Haar hat**? **Das Haar ist ihr zur Decke gegeben**. (1.Kor 11,15) **Ist aber jemand unter euch, der Lust zu zanken hat, der wisse, dass wir solche Weise nicht haben, die Gemeinden Gottes auch nicht.** (1.Kor 11,16; Luther 1912)

You would think the clarity of v. 16 would silence all those who wrongly say a woman’s _head covering_ is a piece of cloth a certain size, shape, color and worn in a particular way, but often it doesn’t. Some continue to embrace their church standards and traditions and remain _contentious_, the very thing Paul just refuted with **_the woman’s long hair is her covering_** teaching. It seems that Biblical truth is not always the real issue for many in these circles. It is instead to _go with the established flow in their group_ and _what has been done in the past._ **These _rules taught by men_ in certain circles have actually nullified these Scriptures for some.**

## Observations About The _Head Covering_

1\. It is possible for a man to have his _head covered_ (v. 4), just like it is possible to have a woman’s _head uncovered_ (v. 5). In both cases it is done with **_hair._**

[![christian head covering](../../files/pictures/christian-head-covering.jpg "Traditions have blinded some groups from the clear meaning of the headcovering for women!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/david-bercot.htm)

2\. It is a disgrace for a _man_ to **cover his head** (have a _head covering_), which is done by **_long hair_** (v. 14).**

3\. For a man to have his head covered is to _dishonor_ his head, who is Christ (v. 3,4), **which is infinitely _more serious_ than a woman dishonoring her husband by having her head uncovered.**

4\. For a woman to have her head uncovered is on a par with having her head shaven bald (v.5).

<a name="christian%20head%20coverings"></a>
**_Hair_** was an issue in the early Christian church. Hence, if you want to conform to that early Christian church standard, then you must adjust to the _hair_ regulations for men and women just cited in Scripture. Such can not be _legalism_ or a _**[works salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/workssalvation.html)**_.

The truth is: It is merely _rules taught by men_ that would state the woman’s **_head covering_** is a piece of _cloth._ **It is _not_ the word of God that teaches that.** Hence, for those who reject this and remain _contentious_ about this issue, Paul’s Holy Spirit inspired teaching still stands about the _head covering:_

> **und dem Weibe eine Ehre, so sie langes Haar hat**? **Das Haar ist ihr zur Decke gegeben.** (1. Kor 11,15) **Ist aber jemand unter euch, der Lust zu zanken hat, der wisse, dass wir solche Weise nicht haben, die Gemeinden Gottes auch nicht.** (1.Kor 11,16; Luther 1912)

**If the woman’s _head covering_ was not clearly stated to be her _long hair_, we would have no idea what it is to be since nothing else is identified as the _head covering_**. Nowhere does it say the _head covering_ is a piece of _cloth_, much less specify the color, shape and how it is to be wore. How can some be so dogmatic about such, yet claim to go by the Bible? Furthermore, how can so many just follow along with no Scriptural support?

While some insist the woman’s head covering is a piece of _cloth_ (usually _white_), one could have just as much Biblical support that the _head covering_ is instead a _brown hat_, a _blue scarf_, a _fig leaf_, etc., since there is **_absolutely no Scriptural defense_** for any of these either. **To elevate a man-made tradition to a _salvation_ issue is DEADLY for the preacher and those who are so deceived (Gal. 1:8,9).** Go by the Bible alone any you'll be safe (2 Tim. 3:16,17). GOD BLESS YOU.
