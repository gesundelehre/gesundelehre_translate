**<big><big>[What Everyone Should Know About God's MERCY](#backslider mercy)</big></big>**

**A _backslider_ in the Bible is a person who once had salvation, but has since turned away from the Lord Jesus to the point that he is now spiritually _lost_ and _dead_ again, just like he was before becoming saved.**

[![backslider return to salvation](../../files/pictures/i-was-saved-again-click-here.jpg "backslider return to salvation")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/i-was-saved-again.htm)

> But **those who turn to crooked ways** the LORD will **banish with the evildoers.** (Psa 125:5)



> A man who strays from the path of understanding **comes to rest in the company of the dead.** (Prov 21:16)

<big>**[Little Known Truth About Eternal Sin](#backslidereternalsin)**</big>

<big>**[Here Is A Backslider's Prayer](#backslidersprayer)**</big>

In the KJV, the only time the word _backslider_ is found is in Proverbs:

> The **backslider** in heart shall be filled with his own ways... (Prov. 14:14).


## Backslider, Backsliding and Backslidden

Ezekiel and Peter give valuable details about those who are _backslidden_ and what occurred when they turned to evil:

> If a righteous man turns from his righteousness and does evil, he will **[die](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.htm)** for it. (Ezek 33:18)

> If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are **again entangled in it and overcome, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning.**

[![Backslider God wants you back](../../files/pictures/backslider-saved-again-spiritual-death-eternal-security-click.jpg "backslider, God wants you back")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.htm)

**It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them.** Of them the proverbs are true: "A dog **returns** to its vomit," and, "A sow that is washed **goes back** to her wallowing in the mud." (2 Pet 2:20-22)

The Bible is filled with examples of people, named and unnamed, who turned away from God temporarily or permanently. Some returned to salvation, like **[King David](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.htm)** and Peter, while others never came back to God, like Kings Saul and **[Solomon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/solomons-apostasy.htm).**

A common contact that our ministry receives is from the grieving _backslider_, who wants to come back to God, but isn't sure that he can. **Some _backsliders_ think they sinned too much and too grievously while others think they committed _eternal sin_ and therefore can't get forgiven.** There is, perhaps, no more downcast person to communicate with than a _repentant backslider_ who isn't sure he can come back to God and find forgiveness, though he desperately wants it!

[![backslider backsliding backslidden](..7..7files/pictures/backslider-future-sins-eternal-security-joseph-prince-charles-stanley.jpg "The backslider is like a pig in the mud.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/expository-2peter2.htm)

Years ago, when I was pastoring, I knew a _backslider_ who fell into sexual immorality. Over the next couple days that same _backslider_ lost nearly 10 pounds and was actually, on occasions, beating his own head against the wall in regret over his sin and foolishness. (He wrongly thought, as a _backslider_, he could not repent and was doomed to **[hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.htm)** with no possible hope of ever getting saved again.) What finally helped that _backslider_ to see that he could come back to God, in spite of his wicked actions, were the examples of King David and the Apostle Peter. **Since God took these men back after they backslid, why should he not take him too, since he was deeply [repentant](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.htm) and resolved to never commit that sin again.**

Other examples of grieving _backsliders_ would vary from people crying to simply asking if they could possibly find forgiveness once again. For such people, we often tell them about Luke 15:11-32\. In our day, we call that teaching _the Parable of the Prodigal Son_ though it is not actually called this in the **[Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.htm).** **The highest authority on the _backslider_, and how God reacts to a repentant backslider,** taught the following:

<big>**[LISTEN TO: _Almost A Backslider_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/audio/AlmostBackslider.mp3)** (mp3)</big>


## God's Truth About Backsliding

> Jesus continued: "There was a man who had two sons. The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So he divided his property between them. Not long after that, the younger son got together all he had, set off for a distant country and there **squandered his wealth in wild living**. 

[![Father welcoming the backslider back home.](../../files/pictures/prodigal.png)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/prodigal-son.htm)

After he had spent everything, there was a severe famine in that whole country, and he began to be in need. So he went and hired himself out to a citizen of that country, who sent him to his fields to feed pigs. He longed to fill his stomach with the pods that the pigs were eating, but no one gave him anything. **When he came to his senses,** he said, 'How many of my father's hired men have food to spare, and here I am starving to death! I will set out and go back to my father and say to him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son; make me like one of your hired men.' So he got up and went to his father. But while he was still a long way off, **his father saw him and was filled with compassion for him; he ran to his son, threw his arms around him and kissed him.** The son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you. I am no longer worthy to be called your son.' But the father said to his servants, 'Quick! Bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. Bring the fattened calf and kill it. Let's have a feast and celebrate. For this son of mine **was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.'** So they began to celebrate. Meanwhile, the older son was in the field. When he came near the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked him what was going on. 'Your brother has come,' he replied, 'and your father has killed the fattened calf because he has him back safe and sound.' The older brother became angry and refused to go in. So his father went out and pleaded with him. But he answered his father, 'Look! All these years I've been slaving for you and never disobeyed your orders. Yet you never gave me even a young goat so I could celebrate with my friends. But when this son of yours who has squandered your property with **prostitutes** comes home, you kill the fattened calf for him!' My son, the father said, 'you are always with me, and everything I have is yours. But we had to celebrate and be glad, because this brother of yours **was dead and is alive again; he was lost and is found.**'"

## Restoring The _Backslider_ and _Backsliding_

[![backsliding return to God](../../files/pictures/backslide-backslider-backsliding-backslidden.jpg "God wants the backsliders to RETURN TO HIM!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.htm)

*   The _backslider_ (or prodigal son in this case) repented when he **came to his senses.** This means a person who remains unrepentant and in sin that is dragging him to hell is not in his right spiritual senses. He has been spiritually blinded by something or deceived somehow.

*   That _backslider_ was able to find forgiveness after he turned from all the wickedness he had been in to serve God. That wise decision reversed the spiritual death he was in and he became _alive again_ (Lk. 15:24). Repentance (turning from sin) to serve God is illustrated in this teaching. Though the _backslider_ was in _wild living,_ including sexual sin with _**[prostitutes](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/prostitution.htm),**_ for an unknown period of time - perhaps many years - he still found forgiveness. **He was still able to return to God and God wanted him back.**

<big>**[RELATED: The Woes Of Sexual Sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/woessexualsin.htm)**</big>

*   The prodigal became **alive _again_** and his _lost_ spiritual condition changed upon turning from all those sins and humbly coming back to the Father to serve him. Compare to 1 Thess. 1:9b.

*   The only time in the Bible that we read where **the Father _ran_** is in this teaching and **it was to welcome the repentant backslider back home!**

*   The Father was so happy to have the _backslider_ home he hugged and _kissed_ him as well as _celebrated._

*   Some Christians who correctly reject the teaching of eternal security wrongly think that **[no one who ever _falls away_ can come back to salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/twicelost.htm)**. That is clearly refuted by Jesus' teaching here, as well as other passages (Rom. 11:19-23 and James 5:19,20).

*   This teaching proves that a spiritually _lost_ and _dead_ person could be a person that was once saved. That truth and the following explain the phrase, God is _married to the backslider_, but few know God gave her a _certificate of divorce_ and sent her away:

> I gave faithless Israel her **certificate of divorce** and sent her away because of all her adulteries. Yet I saw that her unfaithful sister Judah had no fear; she also went out and committed adultery. (Jer 3:8)

## <a name="backslider mercy"></a>
_Mercy_ to the _Repentant Backslider_

The fact that God **delights to show [mercy](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mercy.htm) to the _repentant_** _backslider_ is illustrated in Jesus' teaching, but also candidly declared in the following passage:

> Who is a God like you, who pardons sin and forgives the transgression of the remnant of his inheritance? You do not stay angry forever but **delight to show mercy.** You will again have compassion on us; you will tread our sins underfoot and **hurl all our iniquities into the depths of the sea** (Micah 7:18,19).

Another relevant passage is:

> He who conceals his sins does not prosper, **but whoever confesses and renounces them finds mercy** (Prov 28:13).

Did you notice that the returned prodigal (backslider) _confessed_ his sins and wicked actions to the _Father_ (and not to any man, including a priest). This is the Lord's teaching on this:

> The son said to him, "**Father, I have sinned against heaven and against you.** I am no longer worthy to be called your son" (Luke 15:21).

The Bible also says about those who sin after getting saved:

> **If** we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness (1 John 1:9).


## <a name="backslidersprayer"></a>Prayer Of a Backslider

David's prayer as a backslider returning to God and **asking God for forgiveness** shows **the pain and misery,** he and others like him, are in. When the **[devil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.htm)** is tempting the righteous to sin, he will never accurately portray sin in this manner:

> For the director of music. A psalm of David. When the prophet Nathan came to him after David had committed adultery with Bathsheba. **Have mercy on me, O God,** according to your unfailing love; **according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin.** For I know **my transgressions, and my sin is always before me.** Against you, you only, have **I sinned and done what is evil in your sight,** so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge. Surely I was sinful at birth, sinful from the time my mother conceived me. Surely you desire truth in the inner parts; you teach me wisdom in the inmost place. **Cleanse me with hyssop, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow.** Let me hear joy and gladness; let the bones you have crushed rejoice. Hide your face from my sins and **blot out all my iniquity. Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me** (Psa 51:1-11).


## Backsliders Prayer

The context of the following for Israel was their _idolatry_. Notice the **_prayer of a backslider_** that is recorded:

> Return, O Israel, to the LORD your God. Your sins have been your downfall! Take words with you and return to the LORD. Say to him: **"Forgive all our sins and receive us graciously, that we may offer the fruit of our lips. Assyria cannot save us; we will not mount war-horses. We will never again say 'Our gods' to what our own hands have made, for in you the fatherless find compassion."** (Hosea 14:1-3)

**NOTE: Had the prodigal (or King David) died physically when in their backslidden condition, they would have gone to _[fiery torment](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternaltorment.htm)._** We can all rejoice that those backsliders came back to the Father, but this is **not always the case. God's _discipline_ doesn't always bring the _backslider_ home (Jer. 32:33).** Many turn away and die physically in that _lost_ condition, such as the Apostle **[Judas Iscariot](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/judas.htm).** Don't be deceived by those who would say that _Judas was **[never saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm).**_ (Please see our book, "[**The Believer's Conditional Security**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dan-corner-the-believers-conditional-security.htm)," pages 279-286.)

Similar to the fact that there are two types of _lost_ people, there are also two types of _wicked_ people - one being a _backslider_. This is reasonable since the spiritually _lost_ are also _**[wicked](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wicked-people-forgiven.htm)**_ in God's eyes. **But many in our day would wrongly consider the backslidden, who were previously saved, _carnal Christians_ or _elect people in grievous sin_ and not unsaved (wicked) at all. Such has been produced by the pernicious theology of _[eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.htm)_ as embraced by multitudes of religiously deceived people. We have noticed that eternal security proponents don't usually repent of their sins until they first learn that there is no such thing as eternal security, once saved always saved or the [perseverance of the saints](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/perseverance-of-the-saints.htm), that is, there is no such thing as security in sin.**

## _Backsliders_ are _Wicked_

Scripture shows that the _backslider_ is _wicked:_

> For the director of music. Of David the servant of the LORD. An oracle is within my heart concerning the sinfulness of **the wicked:** There is no **[fear of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/fear-of-God.htm)** before his eyes. For in his own eyes he flatters himself too much to detect or hate his sin. The words of his mouth are wicked and deceitful; **he has ceased to be wise and to do good.** Even on his bed he plots evil; he commits himself to a sinful course and does not reject what is wrong (Psa 36:1-4).

> Wisdom will save you from the ways of **wicked** men, from men whose words are perverse, **who leave the straight paths to walk in dark ways** (Prov 2:12,13).

That fact is also a deathblow to the **[Charles Stanley eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.htm)** teaching because **the _wicked_ are always unsaved people on the road to the fiery furnace:**

> **Salvation is far from the wicked,** for they do not seek out your decrees (Psa 119:155).
> 
> This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the **wicked** from the righteous and **throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth** (Mat 13:49,50).

> You are not a God who takes pleasure in evil; **with you the wicked cannot dwell.** (Psa 5:4)

**NOTE: The _wicked_ of Psa. 5:4 will not dwell with God. That is the same exact Hebrew term for the _wicked_ in Prov. 2:12,13 showing backsliders are _lost and dead_, as the prodigal was before he repented and became _alive again_ (Lk. 15:24).**

## How To Help A _Backslider_

**To help a backslider, show him how to become Biblically _wise._** To be a Biblically _wise_ person, one must put into _practice_ the **[word of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wordgod.htm)** and by doing such he is identified as a member of Jesus' spiritual family. Dear _backslider_, take to heart Jesus' teaching on this:

> Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and **puts them into practice** is like a **wise** man who built his house on the rock. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house; yet it did not fall, because it had its foundation on the rock. But everyone who hears these words of mine and does not put them into practice is like a **foolish** man who built his house on sand. The rain came down, the streams rose, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell with a great crash (Mt. 7:24-27).

> He replied, "**My mother and brothers are those who hear God's word and put it into practice**" (Luke 8:21).

Getting back to Psalm 36:3, to _**cease to be wise and to do good**_ shows that such a person was once God's child at a prior point in time, but since (as a _backslider_) has lost that spiritual identity and taken on a new identity - _wicked_. **In other words, when one turns to this degree he loses his salvation. The _backslider_ is no longer saved.** This is taught other times in the Bible:

> But **those who turn to crooked ways the LORD** will banish with the evildoers (Psa 125:5).
> 
> But rebels and sinners will both be broken, and **those who forsake the LORD will perish** (Isa 1:28).

## <a name="backslidereternalsin"></a>Eternal Sin and The Backslider

[![](../../files/pictures/unforgivable-sin-click.jpg "unforgivable sin")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal_sin_blasphemy_of_Holy_Spirit.htm)

Jesus was the only one who ever mentioned **[eternal sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal_sin_blasphemy_of_Holy_Spirit.htm)** and at the same time told us clearly what it is:

> But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an **eternal sin.** He said this because **they were saying, "He has an evil spirit"** (Mark 3:29,30).

If you read Mark 3:22 you will learn more about those who committed such a form of _blasphemy._ **They were saying that Jesus had a demon and by the power of the devil he was casting them out and performing his [miracles](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/miracles.htm).** This is what Jesus identified as _eternal sin._ It is **not** adultery, murder, disowning Jesus, or any other kind of sin. All of the latter can be forgiven, but not blasphemy of the Holy Spirit, also known as _eternal sin._ **Another sin that can't be forgiven is taking the _[mark of the beast](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/markbeast.htm),_ Rev. 14:9-12\.** (Eternal sin is apparently the type of sin those mentioned in **[Heb. 6:4-6](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hebrews.htm)** committed and, therefore, they could not be renewed again by repentance.)

So, _backslider_ return to God. Backsliders come back to Christ. **[Almighty God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.htm)** wants you back. **It is the devil that is tormenting your mind and trying to make you think you cannot repent and return to God.** Remember also all the good that Peter did after he returned to God from his backslidden condition. **God used him mightily and can do the same with you. Yes, _returned backsliders_ can do great things for the kingdom of God. If you have been a _backslider_, but since have sincerely repented to return to God, he has accepted you home as he did the Prodigal and others.** Believe it. That is the truth. May God use these eternal truths to enlighten _backsliders_, who are in desperate need and earnestly desire to return to God.
