## They Are Teaching The Christian's _Future Sins Are Already Forgiven!_

<big><big><big>**[<font color="blue">PROOF That _Past Sins_ Are Forgiven - NOT _Future Sins_](#future%20sins)**</big></big></big> 

[![future sins](../../files/pictures/future-sins-forgiven.jpg "future sins")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/etlicense.html)

**The security-in-sin teachers have gone so far as to say that a _Christian's future sins are already forgiven,_ even before they are committed. Perhaps they teach this way in an effort to safeguard their doctrine of [eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) while they continue to tickle ears.** I have heard at least one state that _if_ it was possible for a Christian to lose his salvation, it could only occur through **[sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html)**. Hence, by removing (in their minds) the only danger to eternal security, they have erected an imagined indestructible shield for its protection. (Unfortunately, like many other Scriptural issues, the **[eternal security teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html)** are oblivious to the two other ways a Christian can lose his salvation besides through sin: [1] Disowning Jesus through persecution and [2] Accepting or preaching a wrong **[plan of salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)**. See chapter 12 in our 801 page book, _[**The Believer's Conditional Security: Eternal Security Refuted**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelical-books.html)_ for a detailed explanation.) Here are two specific examples of what we are dangerously being taught from eternal security teachers **[Charles Stanley](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-stanley.html), [Joseph Prince](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/joseph-prince-destined-to-reign.html)** and **David Jeremiah** respectively:

> **No matter what you do as a child of God, you are forgiven.** You say, "Murder?" **Forgiven.** "Stealing?" **Forgiven.** "Adultery?" **Forgiven.** "Worshiping Idols?" **Forgiven.**
> 
> His blood that was shed forgives **all your sins - past, present and even future sins. Many Christians have the erroneous belief that only their past sins have been forgiven. They believe that when they received Christ, only their past sins were forgiven.** So they believe that they have to be very careful from that point onwards.
> 
> **Do you realize that when God forgives you, he forgives** your past, **your present and your future sin**? Some people struggle with that terribly. They think that God only forgives them of all the sin they committed until they were converted. I had a lady tell me one day, she said, "You know, I know my sins were forgiven when I accepted Christ, but I've done a lot of other sin. How am I forgiven for that?" Well, **you were already forgiven.**

If you are a Christian, try to put yourself in their shoes thinking that your future sins are already forgiven before you commit them.

[![backslider backsliding backslidden](../../files/pictures/backslider-future-sins-eternal-security-joseph-prince-charles-stanley.jpg "The backslider is like a pig in the mud")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html)

If you accepted that premise, as taught by the so-called **[_pastor_ Joseph Prince](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/joseph-prince-destined-to-reign.html)**, etc., then **your spiritual guard is not only down it is _gone._ You won't ever need to guard against personal sin and its defiling abilities since you are _already forgiven._** This would mean you will always remain spiritually pure, just as you were the day you were saved, **even if you would turn to sexual immorality, [drunkenness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/drunk.html), theft, idolatry, lying, murder, etc.** You would never have to confess those sins to God that you committed after conversion, repent of them, **[forgive others](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/forgive.html)** who sinned against you, etc. to be purified, forgiven and cleansed, since you were never contaminated by any sin after conversion. In contrast, the **_spiritual danger_** of failing to do these is clear to anyone who has read through the New Testament with spiritual ears to hear and eyes to see, yet is seemingly hidden from the security-in-sin teachers themselves. Let me cite some of the reasons why Christians reject the above deplorable teaching as taught by **[once saved always saved Charles Stanley](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**, David Jeremiah and many others.

## The Scriptural Evidence Against Future Sins Forgiven

Please notice what Jesus said to the Christians, after his infinite death on the cross for every person's sins:

> Yet you have **a few people** in Sardis who **have not soiled their clothes.** They will walk with me, dressed in white, for they are worthy. (Rev 3:4)

Comment: All the other people in the church at Sardis did _soil_ their spiritual clothes and were no longer **_worthy_** to walk with Jesus dressed in white. How did the majority, who were previously saved, get _soiled_? The answer is clear when you realize that **sin can defile a Christian and even bring him to his [spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html). That is why we have the following Scripture (among others):**

> **... Do not share in the sins of others. [Keep yourself pure](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/keep-yourself-pure.html).** (1 Tim 5:22)

Paul believed Timothy could become spiritually defiled again through sin and consequently told Timothy to keep himself pure. That would be meaningless, if Timothy would turn to sin and automatically be pre-forgiven. Paul (and others) were repeatedly teaching like this, even to the point of telling Christians they could _die_ spiritually through sin and _not inherit the kingdom of God:_

> For if you live according to the sinful nature, **you will die;** but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live (Rom 8:13)
> 
> but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, **gives birth to death. Don't be deceived, my dear brothers.** (James 1:14-16)
> 
> The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this **[will not inherit the kingdom of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/will-not-inherit-the-kingdom-of-God.htm).** (Gal 5:19-21)

**At this point, I could stop this article, for it has already been proven that sin committed after conversion can defile a Christian, bring him to his spiritual death and cause him not to inherit the kingdom of God.** All of that would be impossible if his future sins were already forgiven before they were committed, like these popular savage wolves in sheep's clothing want us all to believe.

## Past Sins NOT _Future Sins_

What the Bible teaches about _past_ sins being forgiven at the point of **[repentance](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)** and a submissive faith in Jesus (Acts 20:21 cf. 26:20) is shown in the following Scripture:

> But if anyone does not have them, he is nearsighted and blind, and has forgotten that **he has been cleansed from his past sins.** (2 Pet 1:9)

That Scripture was written about any person who had been saved, but since has forgotten he was cleansed from **_his past sin._** Please note, a Christian at the point of salvation is cleansed from all his sins up to that moment - **_his past sins_**, according to Peter. Similarly, Paul stated below:

> When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. **He forgave us all our sins** (Col 2:13)

_All our sins_ were forgiven in a moment's time when we got _born again._ If a Christian is afterwards deceived or yields to the devil's temptations to sin, the following is given as a remedy:

> **If we confess our sins,** he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 1:9)

The Apostle John put himself in on that Scripture by using the plural pronoun _we._ In other words, if we don't _confess_ those sins to God, which are committed after conversion, then we won't be purified from their effects. (Apparently, no person who believes what the security-in-sin teachers proclaim about this will confess his sins to God and renounce them to get purified, since he thinks they are already forgiven.)

> He who conceals his sins does not prosper, but **whoever confesses and renounces them finds [mercy](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mercy.htm).** (Prov 28:13)

There are other indications that a Christian's future sins are not forgiven and that sin can spiritually defile a believer, even though Jesus died for all sins nearly 2000 years ago:

> See to it that no one misses the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up to cause trouble and **defile many.** (Heb 12:15)
> 
> Since we have these promises, dear friends, let us purify ourselves from everything that **contaminates body and spirit,** perfecting holiness out of reverence for God. (2 Cor 7:1)

Also, notice the following Scripture which shows that the Apostle Paul knew of _some_ who wandered away from a _pure heart._ In other words, sin can adversely affect a _pure heart._ **That would be impossible if their _future sins_ were already forgiven:**

> The goal of this command is love, which comes from **a pure heart** and **a good conscience** and **a sincere faith.** Some have wandered away from these and turned to meaningless talk. (1 Tim 1:5,6)

As Christians, we are also to have a certain frame of mind, a certain type of _hope_ that will _purify:_

> Dear friends, now we are children of God, and what we will be has not yet been made known. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. Everyone who has **this hope in him purifies himself, just as he is pure.** (1 John 3:2,3)

**Jesus taught openly that sin can drag any person guilty of [lust](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lust.html) to _[hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html):_**

> But I tell you that **anyone** who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be **thrown into hell.** (Mat 5:28,29)

The Lord also stated the stipulation for a Christian to get his sins forgiven, that is, **he must forgive others who sin against him.** Such a teaching would be impossible if his future sins were all automatically forgiven even before they were committed. If that was true then there would be no conditions to get forgiven, unlike what Jesus stated:

> For if you forgive men when they sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But **if you do not forgive men their sins, your Father will not forgive your sins.** (Mat 6:14,15)
> 
> Then the master called the servant in. "You wicked servant," he said, "I canceled all that debt of yours because you begged me to. Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant just as I had on you?" In anger his master turned him over to the jailers to be tortured, **until he should pay back all he owed.** This is how my heavenly Father will treat each of you **unless you forgive** your brother from your heart. (Mat 18:32-35)

That is not all we read about a Christian's sins getting forgiven. The prayer of faith can bring healing to the body, as well as **forgiveness of sins:**

> Is any one of you sick? He should call the elders of the church to pray over him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will make the sick person well; the Lord will raise him up. **If he has sinned, he will be forgiven.** (James 5:14,15)



## Another Death Blow To _Future Sins_ Automatically Forgiven

Another deathblow to the lie that a Christian's future sins are already forgiven is the following passage:

> **If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth,** no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of **raging fire that will consume the [enemies of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/enemies-of-God.html).** (Heb 10:26, 27)

Clearly, Heb. 10:26,27 is referring to people who had been converted then decided to deliberately _sin_ in a certain way. Instead of believing the ear-tickling deadly lies of our day, let's all cleave to the message of the **[Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)**. Among other things it will show us the following, which also would be impossible if a Christian's future sins were already forgiven:

> So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, **make every effort to be found spotless, blameless and at peace with him.** (2 Pet 3:14)

**Being _found spotless, blameless and at [peace with God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/peace.htm)_ is not automatic. Christians under grace are to put forth every effort to remain in this condition:**

> **Make every effort** to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will **not** be able to. (Luke 13:24)



## Former Sins Not _Future Sins_ in Romans 3:25

**The final nail in the OSAS coffin on this point, about future sins forgiven, comes from Romans 3:25.** Read the clarity for yourself from different translations:

> Whom God displayed publicly as a propitiation in His blood through faith. This was to demonstrate His righteousness, because in the forbearance of God He passed over the **sins previously committed** (NASB)

> Whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His forbearance God had passed over the **sins that were previously committed** (NKJV)

> Whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over **former sins** (ESV)

Dear reader, don't let yourself, family or friends be deceived by the eternal security teachers Scriptural distortions. Contend for the faith against their deadly teachings. Souls hang in the balance. Don't be deceived by large mega congregations, like **[Joseph Prince church](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/joseph-prince-destined-to-reign.html)**! Avoid **[Joseph Prince podcast](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/joseph-prince-destined-to-reign.html)** too for your own good! **Remember: your _future sins are NOT automatically forgiven_**.
