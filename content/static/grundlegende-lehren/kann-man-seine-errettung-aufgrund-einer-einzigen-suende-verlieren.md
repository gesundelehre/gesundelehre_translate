## Can We Lose Salvation? YES,  According To Scripture!

![lose eternal salvation with one sin](../../files/pictures/devil-lose-salvation.jpg) 

**_Can we lose salvation_ ever over anything we do? Some wrongly think we can _never lose salvation._ The truth is, in some (but not all) cases, we can die spiritually over one sin!** Over the years as I have _contended_ for the faith **[against eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** (Jude 3,4), I have met some people who say they reject eternal security, but then teach a Christian can engage in _occasional_ acts of adultery, drunkenness, theft, etc. and remain saved. Such usually deny the truth that **[King David lost his salvation when in unrepentant adultery and murder](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html)**. Others have said it is possible to lose your salvation, but it is _very hard_ to do so. One even stated that _you must tell God that you don't want him_ before you'll lose your salvation. It is the purpose of this teaching to examine the Biblical evidence for these claims to see if they have validity and to ascertain **if Scripture states salvation can be lost with a single act of certain kinds of sin.** (Please know that the view _**[sin is sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/james210.htm)**_ **(all sin is of the same degree) is false!** Some sin does **[lead to death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sinuntodeath.html)** while others don't, 1 John 5:16,17).

**How many times must a righteous person sin in order to lose his salvation? Must it be _lifestyle_ or _continuous_ sinning? Does one have to [_practice sin_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/practice-sin.htm) before he becomes rejected by God?** Is that what true **[Christian beliefs about God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-beliefs.html)** are? Let's look at God's word.



## How Do You Lose Salvation

True _grace_ teaching about **[eternal salvation vs losing salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/getsaved.html)** declares:

> Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither **fornicators**, nor **idolaters**, nor **adulterers**, nor **effeminate**, nor **homosexuals**, nor **thieves**, nor _the_ **covetous**, nor **drunkards**, nor **revilers**, nor **swindlers**, will inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:9,10, NASB).

[![davids sins of adultery murder](../../files/pictures/how-did-david-die.jpg "davids sins of adultery murder")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)

According to the above Scripture, if any person (even one who once had eternal salvation) is described there he will not inherit the kingdom of God. **So how hard is it to become a bible-defined _adulterer_ or any of the others in the list?** Must a person _practice_ adultery before he becomes a bible-defined **adulterer**? Must it be _lifestyle_? Here are the facts:

> If a man commits adultery with another man's wife - with the wife of his neighbor - both the **adulterer** and the adulteress must be put to death. (Lev 20:10)

**As just shown, God's word is consistent with the definition of the word _adulterer_ - one who commits adultery. Hence, any person who commits one or more acts of adultery is an _adulterer_.** The same can likewise be said about the other words bolded in 1 Cor. 6:9,10\. The definition is **one who commits that particular act**, whether it is stealing, drunkenness, idolatry, etc. It doesn't have to be 5, 16, or 113 times or the nebulous _lifestyle_ before he becomes a fornicator, idolater, adulterer, effeminate, homosexual, thief, covetous, drunkard, reviler or swindler of 1 Cor. 6:9,10\. This is crystal clear, as shown above, with the word _adulterer._



## It Doesn't Have To Be _Continual   _or _Lifestyle_ Sinning To Lose Eternal Salvation

![Property of Evangelical Outreach. If you disown Jesus, He will disown you.](../../files/pictures/disowns.jpg)

Other Scriptures reveal the same devastating truth, refuting the idea that _continual_ or _lifestyle_ sinning is the only way we can lose salvation. For example:

> If a man strikes someone with an iron object so that he dies, he is a **murderer**; the murderer shall be put to death. (Num 35:16)

**Again, a single act of _murder_ makes a person a _murderer_**. (That would include suicides, who are self-murderers.) Such a single act of sin will exclude any person from God's Kingdom, unless he repents. [The Biblical **[repentance definition](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)** is to _turn from evil]:_

> But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the **murderers**, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars - **their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur**. This is the second death. (Rev 21:8)



## _Disown _Jesus and You Will Lose Salvation

![Disown Jesus, lose salvation](../../files/pictures/disown-guy.jpg)

The Lord Jesus told those who already had eternal salvation the following:

> But whoever disowns me before men, I will disown him before my Father in heaven. (Mat 10:33)

Later we learn that all of the original apostles, except **[Judas Iscariot the apostle](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/judas.html)** who betrayed Jesus, _disowned_ the Lord:

> Then Jesus told them, "This very night you will all **fall away** on account of me, for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee." Peter replied, "Even if all **fall away** on account of you, I never will." "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "this very night, before the rooster crows, **you will disown me three times**." But Peter declared, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you." And all the other disciples said the same. (Mat 26:31-35)

So how hard was it for Peter to _disown_ Jesus and _fall away_? It wasn't very hard and occurred in a **short period of time**:

> Now Peter was sitting out in the courtyard, and a servant girl came to him. "**You also were with Jesus of Galilee," she said. But he denied it before them all. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said**. Then he went out to the gateway, where another girl saw him and said to the people there, "**This fellow was with Jesus of Nazareth." He denied it again, with an oath: "I don't know the man!"** After a little while, those standing there went up to Peter and said, "**Surely you are one of them, for your accent gives you away." Then he began to call down curses on himself and he swore to them, "I don't know the man!"** Immediately a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word Jesus had spoken: "Before the rooster crows, you will **disown me** three times." And he went outside and wept bitterly. (Mat 26:69-75)

[![lose salvation](../../files/pictures/Jesus-disowned-peter.jpg "lose salvation")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)

Just like Peter, a real Christian can _disown_ Jesus (or _fall away_). The Apostle Peter did this by denying he was with Jesus or knew Him. He didn't have to say, _I don't want you_ (and it didn't have to be _lifestyle_). **What Peter said was enough to cause Jesus to disown Peter! If Jesus _disowns_ you, then you aren't his sheep anymore, just like other unsaved people. Christians are described as God's possessions: his sheep (John 10:26,27; 21:16,16), his bride (Rev. 19:7), his body (Eph. 5:23; Col. 1:24); etc.**



## Who Says _You Cannot Lose Your Salvation_

The first act of disobedience by man in the Bible occurred in Gen. 3\. God had forewarned Adam that the day he would eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil he would _die_ (Gen. 2:17). That is exactly what happened **with a single act of sin**. It wasn't _lifestyle habitual practice_, but **a single act of sin that brought both Adam and Eve to their [spiritual death in the Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html).**



## David Became An _Evildoer_ and Died

Shockingly, even people exceedingly strong in faith can afterwards stray to the point of committing sin that leads to death. Again, David did that. David's glaring sins were one act of adultery and one act of murder, which would exclude him from God's kingdom and place him in the lake of fire (1 Cor. 6:9,10, Rev. 21:8), but he repented. (David got saved again.) For at least 9 months, he was a bible-defined _adulterer_ and _murderer_ because of his single acts of adultery and murder. Nathan told David:

> Why did you despise the word of the LORD by **doing what is evil** in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. (2 Sam 12:9)

[![Christian can lose salvation die spiritually spiritual death](../../files/pictures/backslider-saved-again-spiritual-death-eternal-security-click.jpg "A Christian can lose salvation or die spiritually")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)

Note, David did what was _evil_. You might say this is no great revelation of truth. Of course adultery and murder are _evil_. But false teachers, some of whom say they reject eternal security, would declare David didn't lose his salvation, even though 1 Cor. 6:9,10 and Rev. 21:8 are so clear. When 2 Sam. 12:9 is coupled with this and the following, we have even more supportive evidence that David did lose his salvation at that dark time in his life:



## David _Died_ Spiritually

> If I tell the righteous man that he will surely live, but then he trusts in his righteousness and **does evil**, none of the righteous things he has done will be remembered; **he will die for the evil he has done**. (Ezek 33:13)

**Those who _do evil_, like David did, _die_ spiritually**, according to the above. The following is also evidence that **David lost his salvation for a time**:

> But if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits sin and **does the same detestable things the wicked man does**, will he live? None of the righteous things he has done will be remembered. **Because of the unfaithfulness** he is guilty of **and because of the sins he has committed, he will DIE**. (Ezek 18:24)
> 
> If a righteous man **turns from his righteousness and does evil, he will DIE for it.** (Ezek 33:18)

> If a righteous man **turns from his righteousness and commits sin, he will die for it; because of the sin he has committed he will DIE**. (Ezek 18:26)

Sadly, some will reject the clarity of these Scriptures and try to distort the facts to say that David didn't lose his salvation (_die_ spiritually) after committing adultery and murder. **Such a person is as bad or even worse than an eternal security teacher, even though he might outwardly deny the teaching of eternal security (like [David Servant](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/david_servant_great_gospel_deception.htm)). Such a person is still teaching a license to sin.**

Note: The strong warnings of Ezek 18:24,26; 33:13,18 were not just _hypothetical_, as some say, **for such happened to David**. Even David knew he was an _evil doer_ during that time and hence **one who _died_ spiritually (not physically) because of his sin:**

> **Have mercy on me, O God**, according to your unfailing love; according to your great compassion blot out my transgressions. Wash away all my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is always before me. Against you, you only, have I sinned and **done what is evil** in your sight, so that you are proved right when you speak and justified when you judge. (Psa 51:1-4)

Furthermore, some like to misuse Psa. 51 to say David only lost the joy of his salvation. They somehow miss how David humbly and sorrowfully asked God for **mercy** because of his sins, as just cited, which is also how Jesus said the repentant tax collector got saved (or _justified_):

> But the tax collector stood at a distance. He would not even look up to heaven, but beat his breast and said, **"God, have mercy on me, a sinner."** I tell you that **this man**, rather than the other, **went home justified before God**. For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who **humbles himself** will be exalted. (Luke 18:13,14)

After David prayed for mercy, forgiveness (and salvation), he also asked for other things like the joy of his salvation to be restored (Psa. 51:12). Psalm 51 is the prayer of a man who had **[backslidden](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/backslider.html)**.



## Proverbs Concurs About Losing Salvation With ONE Sexual Sin

**ONE ACT OF SEXUAL SIN WILL DESTROY YOUR SALVATION AND SEND YOU TO HELL, UNLESS YOU REPENT!** The context of Prov. 7:23-27 is about a young man who gets seduced. This is what it is like for such a person who goes after the adulteress. He is like a deer stepping into a noose...:

> **... till an arrow struck his liver.** As a bird hastens to the snare, He did not know **it would cost HIS LIFE.** Now therefore, listen to me, my children; Pay attention to the words of my mouth: Do not let your heart turn aside to her ways, Do not stray into her paths; For she has cast down MANY wounded, and all who were slain by her were strong men. **Her house is the way to HELL,** descending to the chambers of death. (Prov. 7:23-27, NKJV)



## Don't _Look Back_ From The Plow

The Lord must have shocked the people of his day by teaching the following:

> But Jesus said to him, "No one, after putting his hand to the plow and **looking back**, is fit for the kingdom of God." (Luke 9:62, NASB)

Another translation says:

> Jesus replied, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for service in the kingdom of God." (Luke 9:62, NIV)

There is no essential difference between these translations because those who do enter God's kingdom will _serve_ Him there (Rev. 22:3). Not to be _fit for service_ in the kingdom of God is not to enter the kingdom of God, but to go to the lake of fire. Either way, **looking back will exclude one from the kingdom of God.** God wants us to be faithful to him and love him more than any person or thing in this world. The Lord elevated this to **a salvation issue** (Mt. 10:37-39; Lk. 14:26,33). James commented similarly:

> You adulterous people, don't you know that friendship with the world is hatred toward God? **Anyone who chooses to be a friend of the world becomes an [enemy of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/enemies-of-God.html)**. (James 4:4)

Christian people who chose to be friends of the world become _enemies of God_ again as they were before their salvation. That is the same as committing _spiritual adultery_. Remember also Lot's wife who looked back one time and was destroyed (Gen. 19:26). Jesus mentioned her:

> Remember Lot's wife. "Whoever seeks to keep his life **will lose it**, and whoever loses _his life_ will preserve it." (Luke 17:32,33)


## You Can Lose Salvation With Words

People have a hard time believing that words can endanger a person to **hell fire**, but Jesus actually taught this:

> But I tell you that anyone who is angry with his brother will be subject to judgment. Again, anyone who says to his brother, "Raca," is answerable to the Sanhedrin. **But anyone who says, "You fool!" will be in danger of the fire of hell.** (Mat 5:22)

Through this single act, such extreme danger of _hell fire_ becomes a reality, even for people previously saved. This parallels another eternal salvation truth about words. Jesus also taught:

> But I tell you that men will have to give account on the day of judgment for **every careless word** they have spoken. For by your words you will be justified, and **by your words you will be condemned**. (Mat 12:37)

Your words can bring _condemnation_ or the opposite which is _justification_. **Remember, Peter _disowned_ Jesus with his _words._**


## Eternal Sin

It is also through words that a person can commit **[eternal sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal_sin_blasphemy_of_Holy_Spirit.html),** which will never be forgiven:

> But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an eternal sin. He said this because they were saying, "**He has an evil spirit**." (Mark 3:29,30)

Notice please that eternal sin is committed through words. It also seems from this Scripture and the historical background of the book of Hebrews, that some of the people addressed there committed eternal sin and couldn't be renewed by repentance (Heb. 6:4-6). Raging fire was awaiting them, even though they had been previously sanctified by the blood of the covenant (Heb. 10:26-29). There was no eternal security for them and there is none for us today.


## _Idolaters_ Are Lost

Paul wrote to those already saved and knew that their spiritual identity could be changed to _idolater_ by a single act of this sin:

> **Do not be idolaters**, as some of them were; as it is written: "The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to indulge in pagan revelry." (1 Cor 10:7)

Paul referred to the golden calf incident in Exodus 32\. Hence, by that **single act of idolatry they became _idolaters_ **and he knew the same could happen to these Christians he addressed. Remember, _idolaters_ will go to the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8).


## Receive The Mark of the Beast and Lose Your Salvation

In spite of the clear warning regarding the **[mark of the beast](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/markbeast.html)**, many will take it because of the heavy pressure to do so. The saints who yield will lose their salvation with this single act of disobedience:

> A third angel followed them and said in a loud voice: "If **anyone** worships the beast and his image and receives his mark on the forehead or on the hand, he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. **He will be tormented with burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb. And the smoke of their torment rises for ever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name**." This calls for patient endurance on the part of **the saints who** obey God's commandments and **remain faithful to Jesus**. (Rev 14:9-12)

[![can you lose salvation](../../files/pictures/can-you-lose-salvation.jpg "Without question you can lose salvation by taking the mark of the beast.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/markbeast.html)

**Despite the clarity of that passage, [John MacArthur and others teach one can take the mark of the beast and get forgiven](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/john-macarthur-forgiven-mark-beast/)! That's antithetical to reality! Faithfulness to Jesus to the end of our life is needed for salvation**, even though it might mean severe persecution and physical death. This is a salvation issue! A Christian can lose his salvation. Hence, Jesus taught:

> Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the devil will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. **Be faithful, even to the point of death**, and I will give you the crown of life. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. **[He who overcomes](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/he-who-overcomes.html) will not be hurt at all by the second death**. (Rev 2:10,11)


## How Do You Lose Salvation

**There are various ways for a Christian to lose his salvation. Sometimes a single act of sin can do it, while at other times it won't happen as abruptly and with a single sin. One example is being _lukewarm_ (Rev. 3:15,16). Furthermore, one doesn't even have to sin to lose their salvation. They can lose it by believing a [false gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html) (1 Cor. 15:2 cf. 1 John 2:24,25) or preaching a false gospel (Gal. 1:8,9)**. What a shock this is to those who have been deceived by those who change grace into a license for immorality by teaching David never lost his salvation or a single act of sin like adultery, suicide or drunkenness won't cause this. Jude identified all who change grace into a license for immorality as ungodly (Jude 3,4), divisive, who don't have the Spirit (v. 19) and for whom blackest darkness is reserved forever (v. 13).

False teachers that declare _lifestyle sinning_ not only ignore or twist the above Scriptures, but also dangerously portray the possibility of a loose, wild, immoral person as being a _Christian._ Ponder 1 Cor. 6:9,10 and the list there. (See also Eph. 5:5-7 and Rev. 21:8.) According to such false teachers, declaring their unscriptural version of _grace_, if a person previously saved commits occasional acts of **fornication, idolatry, adultery, being effeminate, homosexuality, theft, covetousness, being drunk, reviling** and **swindling all at the same time** he remains saved. This is a horrible and deadly **[distortion of the true _Christian_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/image-of-a-christian.htm)**described in the Bible. Please note that Paul didn't have to consider the _lifestyle_ of Elymas to know he was a _child of the devil_ (Acts 13:10). See also 1 John 3:10.

**Moreover, such a teacher proclaiming _lifestyle_ sinning is no real friend of the immoral, since he is only endangering their souls to hell by misleading them with a false salvation security. They are not being merciful or loving by preaching their lies and tickling the ears of the backslidden. The loving and vital message the immoral need to know is they must turn from such sin for _salvation's sake._**

False shepherds say the righteous person who becomes an _evil doer_ can still go to heaven, but Jesus made it crystal clear such will instead rise to be _condemned_ and thrown into _the fiery furnace:_

> Those who have done good will rise to live, and **those who have done evil will rise to be condemned**. (John 5:29)
> 
> The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will weed out of his kingdom **everything that causes sin** and **all who do evil**. They will **throw them into the fiery furnace**, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. (Mat 13:41,42)


## Both Are Just As _Deadly_

**The bottom line difference between eternal security teachers, who unashamedly declare a Christian can commit the _occasional_ acts of sin such as cited in 1 Cor. 6:9,10 and remain saved, and those who say they reject eternal security but teach the same, is non-existent! There really is no difference. Both are just as _deadly_ and are misleading people to hell by their teachings.** If you are a real Christian **[flee from such a congregation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/keepaway.html)** and so-called "pastor," regardless how convenient it may be to remain. Don't endanger your eternal soul and the souls of those you love by attending and supporting such a ravenous wolf in sheep's clothing. Don't share in his wicked work (2 John 10,11). **Those who say _you can never lose salvation_ are grossly deceived. We can lose our salvation (die spiritually) and many have.**
