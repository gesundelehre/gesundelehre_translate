## Are YOU A _Slave To The Power Of Sin_

[![cords of sin slave to sin](../../files/pictures/devil-battle.jpg "cords of sin slave to sin")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans6.html)

Throughout the Bible, one can read of man having the _rule_ over fish, birds, living creatures (Gen. 1:26) and people **ruling** over other people (1 Sam. 14:47; 2 Sam. 19:10), but then we come to other verses which show that **sins can _rule_ over people. _Sin has power_ to destroy, bind and control people:** 
> Keep your servant also from **willful sins; may they not rule over me.** Then will I be blameless, innocent of great transgression. May the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer (Psa. 19:13,14).

> Direct my footsteps according to your word; **let no sin rule over me** (Psa. 119:133).

The Hebrew word for _rule_ is _mashal_ and means: 
> **to rule:**--(have, make to have) **dominion**, governor, X indeed, **reign**, (bear, cause to, have) **rule (-ing, -r), have power.** 

**[ONLY This Will Set Us Free From Our Slavery To Sin](#slave%20of%20sin%20blood%20of%20christ)** 

## The Wicked Are Slaves Of Sin

[![sin is sin](../../files/pictures/sin-is-sin.jpg "sin is sin")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/james210.htm)

There are only two types of people, the _wicked_ (or lost) and the _righteous_ (or saved). Regarding the former, Proverbs 5:22 declares that they are _take_[n] (KJV) or _ensnared_ (NIV) by their sin. That word _ensnared_ in the Hebrew is _lakad_ and means: 
> **to catch** (in a net, trap or pit); gen. **to capture** or occupy; also to choose (by lot); fig. to cohere:-- X at all, **catch** (self), **be frozen, be holden, stick together**, take. 

Notice the clarity of this verse: 
> The evil deeds of a wicked man **ensnare him**; the **cords of his sin hold him fast** (Prov. 5:22). 

The Hebrew word for _cords_ means: 
> **a rope (as twisted)**, espec. a measuring line; by impl. a district or inheritance (as measured); or a **noose (as of cords)**; fig. a company (as if tied together); also a throe (espec. of parturition); also ruin:--band, coast, company, **cord**, country, destruction, line, lot, pain, pang, portion, region, **rope, snare,** sorrow, tackling.

Other similar verses can also be cited:  
[![bound to sin](../../files/pictures/chained-feet.jpg)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin-is-the-issue.htm) 
> ... the wicked are **ensnared** by the work of their hands (Psa. 9:16).

> Do not make friends with a hot-tempered man, do not associate with one easily angered, or you may learn his ways and get yourself **ensnared** (Prov. 22:24,25).

> The images of their gods you are to burn in the fire. Do not **covet** the silver and gold on them, and do not take it for yourselves, or you will be **ensnared** by it, for it is detestable to the LORD your God (Deut. 7:25).

Verse 26 gives the remedy for coveting silver and gold on idols: 
> **Do not bring a detestable thing into your house** or you, like it, will be set apart for destruction. **Utterly abhor and detest it**, for it is set apart for destruction.

Another example of idolatry _ensnaring_ those that are involved in it is found in the same OT book: 
> And after they have been destroyed before you, be careful not to be **ensnared** by inquiring about their gods, saying, "How do these nations serve their gods? We will do the same" (Deut. 12:30).

The imagery of these Scriptures shows the powerless spiritual condition the unsaved are in (Rom. 5:6), that is, as a _captured_ victim ensnared by _cords_ (or _ropes_) of sin. Beyond all of that he is also a _slave to sin._ 

## [This Proves Sin Is Still The Issue](sin-is-the-issue.htm)

## Jesus Will Set You _Free_ From The Power of Sin

In the following passage, **_the truth_ (which sets one free from sin) is equated with _the Son_, that is, Jesus Christ Himself:** 
> Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and **the truth will set you free**." They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been **slaves** of anyone. **How can you say that we shall be set free?**" Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, **everyone who sins is a slave to sin**. Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So **if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed**" (John 8:31-36).

The Apostle John went into specifics about how this freedom from being a _**[slave to sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/slave.htm)**_ occurs: 
<a name="slave%20of%20sin%20blood%20of%20christ"></a>
> And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and has **freed us from our sins by his blood** (Rev. 1:5).

In other words, we **must** contact the _blood_ of Christ to receive _freedom_ from sin's slavery. This means that people who never get Biblically saved have been lifelong _slaves of sin_, even though they might not be aware of it. While certain sins clearly _enslave_, like drunkenness, homosexuality and pornography, other sins such as lying, fits of rage and discord are not so apparent, but can still be spiritually fatal (Gal. 5:19-21). But regardless the sin, Jesus' precious, cleansing _blood_ is the **only** remedy for sin's spiritual _bondage_. Moreover, one contacts Jesus' blood at salvation by coming to _know_ the Lord Jesus in a personal way and simultaneously _escapes_ sin's bondage: 
> ... _escape the corruption of the world **by knowing** our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ_ (2 Pet. 2:20). 

The same Greek word translated _escape_ in that verse is also found in 2 Pet. 1:4\. Clearly, it is Christians who **_escape_** _the corruption in the world caused by evil desires_:

> His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through **our knowledge of him** who called us by his own glory and goodness. Through these he has given us his very great and precious promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature and **escape** the corruption in the world caused by evil desires (2 Pet. 1:3,4).

## [Click For More Truth About JESUS' Blood](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesusblood.html) 
## _Captive_ To Sin Again

**It is very important to stress the fact that even a person who has once been _freed_ from the controlling power of sin by Jesus' blood, can become a _captive to sin_ again**. Consider the words of the Apostle Peter to Simon, who previously came to the point of _**[believing](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/believing.html)**_, which merited Christian baptism (Acts 8:13): 
> Repent of this wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive you for having such a thought in your heart. For I see that you are full of bitterness and **captive to sin** (Acts 8:22, 23). 

That Apostle also wrote of this same possibility reoccurring to those who had been truly saved. In 1 Peter, his audience was already _born again_ (1:23) and _redeemed_ by **[Jesus _precious blood_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesusblood.html)** (1:18), but such would not, in itself, prevent them from becoming _captive_ to sin again, as occurred to Simon (Acts 8:13, 23). Consequently, there has to be free will and human responsibility involved in staying free. Instead of conforming to the evil desires we had when unsaved, Christians are commanded to _**be holy in all you do:**_ 
> As obedient children, **do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance**. But just as he who called you is holy, so **be holy in all you do**; for it is written: "**Be holy**, because I am holy" (1 Pet. 1:14-16). 
## _Be Holy in All You Do_

**Peter knew a real Christian could once again _conform to the evil desires_ he had when he _lived in ignorance_**. The preventive is to **_be holy_ in all we do**. Christians are in a constant, day in and day out battle with sin. This and more are clear from the following: 
> **In your struggle against sin**, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood (Heb. 12:4). 

In Peter's second epistle, he wrote about certain **[false teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm),** who _have left the straight way and wandered off to follow the way of Balaam_ (2 Pet. 2:15). Besides being covetous, they were also guilty of **[mental adultery](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lust.html)** (v. 14 cf. Mt. 5:28). Hence, Peter declared them to be _slaves of depravity_ [again]: 
> They promise them freedom, while they themselves are **slaves of depravity**--for a man is a **slave** to whatever has mastered him (2:19).

But that is not all the Apostle wrote about those apostates, that is, Christians who leave _the straight way_ (or faith): 
> If they have **escaped** [past tense] the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and are **again entangled in it and overcome**, they are worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. **It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command**[(1)](#1) **that was passed on to them**. Of them the proverbs are true: "A dog **returns** to its vomit," and, "A sow that is washed **goes back** to her wallowing in the mud" (2 Pet. 2:20-22). 

**Not only did Peter know the believer's security was conditional, but he boldly and unequivocally taught that a true Christian can _leave the straight way_. Some, however, refuse to accept this Scriptural fact and in opposition to it parrot: _They were [never really saved to begin with](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm)_. To live in _the straight way_ carries the same benefit as _having escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ_**. But such a person, who departs from _the straight way_, will then become _entangled_ and _overcome_ by sin's corruption _again_! It is about such former Christians, who _turn their backs on the sacred command_ that Peter stated: 
> It would have been better for them not to have **known the way of righteousness**, than to have known it and then to **turn their backs** on the sacred command that was passed on to them. 

## The Danger of Backsliding

In other words, **do not [backslide](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/backslider.html)** or sin's _entanglement_ and _slavery_ will be worse than it was before initial salvation! But if backsliding has already occurred, **one can get saved (and _freed_) again**, according to the Biblical record: 
> For this son of mine was dead and **is alive again; he was lost and is found**. So they began to celebrate (Lk. 15:24).

> **Brethren, if anyone among you wanders from the truth, and someone turns him back**, let him know that **he who turns a sinner from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins** (James 5:19, 20, NKJV).

> You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in." Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and **you stand by faith**. Do not be arrogant, but **be afraid**. For **if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either**. Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but **kindness to you, provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off**. And if they do not persist in unbelief, they will be grafted in, for **God is able to graft them in again** (Rom. 11:19-23).

## _He Will Not Spare You Either_

Sometimes in a feeble effort to save the false teaching of _eternal security_, proponents of such will try to dismiss Rom. 11:19-23 as only _referring to Israel_. By doing this, they somehow overlook the following two clauses from that passage: (1) _if God did not spare the natural branches, **he will not spare you either**_ and (2) _kindness to you, **provided that you continue in his kindness. Otherwise, you also will be cut off.**_ 

Dear reader, **do not be deceived by the false _grace_ message of OSAS (**[once saved, always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**). We must endure to the end for salvation's sake (Mt. 10:22), be faithful to the very end of our lives, so we won't be hurt by the second death (Rev. 2:10,11), and hold firmly to the end to share in Christ (Heb. 3:14)**. Furthermore, John wrote: 
> See that what you have heard from the beginning remains in you. **If it does, you also will remain in the Son and in the Father.** And this is what he promised us-even **eternal life** (1 Jn. 2:24, 25).

**According to true grace teaching, eternal life is a _hope_ (Titus 3:7), yet to be _reaped_ (Gal. 6:8,9), in the _age to come_ (Mk. 10:30), for only the ones who _persist in doing good_ (Rom. 2:7) and don't grow weary and _give up_ (Gal. 6:9).** 
## The Devil's _Captive_

The apostle Paul also noted the spiritual _captivity_ that an unsaved person is in. Hence, he informed Timothy how God's truth is to be presented _to those who oppose him_: 
> And the Lord's servant must not quarrel; instead, he must be kind to everyone, able to teach, not resentful. Those who oppose him he must gently instruct, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, and that they will come to their senses and escape from **the trap of the devil**, who has **taken them captive** to do his will (2 Tim. 2:24-26).

Remember also that **all unsaved people are _controlled by the sinful nature:_** 
> For when we **were controlled by the sinful nature**, the sinful passions aroused by the law were at work in our bodies, so that we bore fruit for death (Rom. 7:5).

John also mentioned the spiritual bondage of the unsaved, termed the _world_ in 1 Jn. 5:19: 
> We know that we are children of God, and that **the whole world is under the control of the evil one.**

Paul also wrote of a Christian's past life of being a _slave_ to sin, but went further to explicitly state that  **they _have been set free from sin_**: 
> **You have been set free from sin** and have become slaves to righteousness. I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves. Just as **you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness**, so now offer them in slavery to righteousness leading to holiness. When **you were slaves to sin, you were free from the control of righteousness**. What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are now ashamed of? **Those things result in death! But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God, the benefit you reap leads to holiness, and the result is eternal life** (Rom. 6:18-22).

## Today's False _Gospel_

Why then doesn't today's _Gospel_ deliver this same kind of power and benefit, that is, _freedom from the being a slave to sin_? The answer is simple. **What is often presented as the _Gospel_ in our dark day is not the real _Gospel_! It is _[another gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html)_, like the kind condemned in Gal. 1:8,9**. The true _Gospel_ has **[repentance](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)** attached to it (Acts 20:21; 26:20; 2 Pet. 3:9; etc.), which means a **turning away from sin** (Mt. 12:41 cf. Jonah 3:10). Furthermore, **godly sorrow** precedes true repentance which leads to salvation (2 Cor. 7:10 cf. James 4:8-10)! Finally, according to 1 Cor. 15:2 and Col. 1:22, 23, the true _gospel_ message also **includes a conditional security for the believer**: 
> **By this gospel** you are saved, **if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.**

> But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation--**if you continue i your faith, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.**

**Only a trusting, submitting and enduring faith in Jesus will save one's eternal soul from the [fires of Hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternaltorment.html). A Christian's faith must continue to the end of his life to inherit the kingdom. This, however, doesn't always happen:** 
> **They believe for a while**, but in the time of testing they fall away (Lk. 8:13).

> holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and so **have shipwrecked their faith**. Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme (1 Tim. 1:19,20).

> Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus, who have wandered away from the truth. They say that the resurrection has already taken place, and **they destroy the faith of some** (2 Tim. 2:17,18).

## [_Wolves in Sheep's Clothing_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wolfsheep.html)
**The implications of 1 Cor. 15:2 and Gal. 1:8,9 indict all those preaching _eternal security_. Such _wolves in sheep's clothing_ (Mt. 7:15) are in serious trouble, especially when Jude 3,4 is also considered:** 
> Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt I had to write and urge you **to contend** for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints. For certain men **whose condemnation was written about long ago** have secretly slipped in among you. They are **godless men, who change the grace of our God into a license for immorality and deny Jesus Christ** our only Sovereign and Lord.

**In Jude's day, those _godless men_ had to _secretly slip in among_ Christians, but in our dark day they are openly preaching the lie of once saved always saved (OSAS) over radio, TV, from pulpits and putting such in print! Sadly, some people who know OSAS is false are even supporting such congregations and ministries with their presence and financial donations! Others promote their deadly influence through their websites by links or article reprints.** 

Remember, what Jude called a counterfeit _grace_ message and _license for immorality_ (Jude 3,4), is termed in our day _eternal security_. Others sometimes call it _once saved always saved_ or _the **[perseverance of the saints](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/perseverance-of-the-saints.htm)**_, but it's the same basic lie from the **[devil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html),** first spoken to Eve in the garden (Gen. 3:4) and afterwards accepted as truth. This teaching led to Adam and Eve's spiritual death. **The essence of that sinister doctrine is that a person who has eternal life cannot afterwards die spiritually. Don't allow the mention of the _cross of Christ_ by [Jimmy Swaggart](jimmy-swaggart-study-in-the-word.htm), or anyone else, to deceive you about that** 

May multitudes in our day become aware of the _freedom_ from sin's slavery found in Jesus' blood through his one and only _gospel_ of grace, and afterwards faithfully work out their own salvation with _fear and trembling_ (Phil. 2:12), being mindful that a true Christian can go back to their old sinful life, die spiritually and become _entangled_ by sin all over again. 

**Finally, may the Lord raise up millions, all over the world, who will fearlessly _contend_ for these Biblical truths, like good Christian soldiers, in spite of how they might suffer for obeying the Lord and opposing the popular, false prophets! Precious eternal souls are hanging in the balance over these issues. _Slaves of sin_ can be set free! The _power of sin_ can be broken through the Lord Jesus Christ!**
