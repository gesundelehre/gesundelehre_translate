**[INTERNET POST BY UNKNOWN MAN Regarding *Divorce and Remarriage*]**  
> I really need some input here. If a Christian man (me) *divorces* his wife due to incompatibility and neglect (and various other mental anguish associated with a marriage that could not/would not be fixed even with MUCH prayer), and has a significant female other who is also a Christian and *divorced* due to abuse and mental cruelty, can they (we) marry each other after being truly forgiven by God for divorcing our spouses? She and I are SO much in love and we want to serve the Lord together as husband and wife. We have read the Bible and seen prohibition of marriage of divorced people, but we know so many Christian couples who are both divorced and remarried and have good, solid marriages and serve the Lord well.  
Thanks for your help.

 **[EVANGELICAL OUTREACH [Bible Answer](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible-answers.html) on _Divorce and Remarriage_]**  
 
**[[Find Out Who Was The Divorced Herodias Married To](#divorceremarriageadultery)]** 
 
 
 Greetings in Jesus' name. You said you really need some input. As a person who has spent thousands of hours reading and studying the **[Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html),** and one who pastored for over 6.5 years in the Pittsburgh area, the following is my input: 
 
 
 (1) To divorce over "incompatibility and neglect" is not a legitimate reason, according to the Word of God! Please note **Matt. 5:32**: 
 > "But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to commit adultery, and anyone who marries a woman so divorced commits adultery." 
 
 [![law of marriage](../../files/pictures/law-of-marriage.jpg)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance-from-remarriage-adultery.html)

Similarly, Scripture states: 
 > "I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery" **(Matt. 19:9)**. 
  
 > "Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman **commits adultery**, and **the man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery**" **(Lk. 16:18)**. 

 > "Some Pharisees came and tested him by asking, 'Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?' 'What did Moses command you?' he replied. They said, 'Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.' 'It was because your hearts were hard that Moses wrote you this law,' Jesus replied. 'But at the beginning of creation God "made them male and female." "For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh." So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore **what God has joined together, let man not separate**.' When they were in the house again, the disciples asked Jesus about this. He answered, '**Anyone who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her. And if she divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery**' " **(Mk. 10:2-12)**. 

## Divorce in Jesus' Day 

The aforementioned Scriptures about divorce and remarriage were given by the Lord Jesus. Clearly, he stated marital unfaithfulness (sexual immorality) is the only cause for a divorce [but the only example of such was when Joseph wrongly thought Mary was sexually immoral WHEN THEY WERE PLEDGED to be married and he was going to "divorce" (Mt. 1:19) her]! Hence, if one divorces his spouse for any other reason besides sexual immorality, regardless what that reason is, he is indicted by these verses!

[![remarriage adultery](../../files/pictures/remarriages.jpg)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/apostatechurch.htm)

**If such a person would then "marry" another, not only would he be committing adultery, but the person he "marries" would likewise be committing adultery! All people, who have never been married, need to know these facts before they consider marrying someone who might not be eligible for marriage again, namely a divorced person.**

When we consider passages like 1 Cor. 6:9,10 and Rev. 21:8, we can only conclude that an adulterous marriage, as referred to in Matt. 5:32 and 19:9, will result in **both parties being thrown into the lake of fire, that is, unless that ceases and they find forgiveness for their adultery**.

## The Innocent Party In A *Divorce* 

[![marriage annulment remarriage adultery](../../files/pictures/marriage-annulment-remarriage-adultery.jpg "The marriage annulment myth leads to remarriage adultery")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html)

On the other hand, Lk. 16:18 seems to teach that even **the [innocent party](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ab.htm) in an unscriptural divorce** that remarries becomes guilty of **adultery**: 
> "Whosoever putteth away his wife, and marrieth another, committeth adultery: and **whosoever marrieth her that is put away from her husband committeth adultery** (KJV)."
 
 The Apostle Paul gave these instructions about remarriage to the Christians of his day: 
 > "And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord, Let not the wife **depart** [or *separate* as some translation have it] from her husband: But and if she **depart, LET HER REMAIN UNMARRIED, or be reconciled to her husband**: and let not the husband put away his wife. But to the rest speak I, not the Lord: If any brother hath a wife that believeth not, and she be pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the woman which hath an husband that believeth not, and if he be pleased to dwell with her, let her not leave him. For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the husband: else were your children unclean; but now are they holy. But if the unbelieving **depart**, let him **depart**. A brother or a sister is not under bondage in such cases: but God hath called us to peace" (1 Cor. 7:10-15). 
 
 The Greek word for "depart" in verses 10, 11 and 15 is also found at Matt. 19:6 and Mk. 10:9 as used with divorce: 
 > "Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, **let** not man **put asunder**." 

 > "What therefore God hath joined together, **let** not man **put asunder**." 

But then on the other hand that same Greek word does **not** have to refer to _divorce_: 

> "After these things Paul **departed** from Athens, and came to Corinth" (Acts 18:1).

> "For perhaps he therefore **departed** for a season, that thou shouldest receive him for ever" (Philemon 15). 

## Until Death Do We Part, Then Remarriage 

[![divorce remarriage adultery what is a marriage](../../files/pictures/what-is-a-marriage.jpg "What is a marriage is defined by GOD, not the world!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-life.html)

**The widow could also remarry, but only IF her spouse dies:**
> "For example, by law **a married woman is bound to her husband as long as he is alive**, but **if her husband dies, she is released from the law of marriage**. So then, **if she marries another man while her husband is still alive, she is called an *adulteress*. But if her husband dies, she is released from that law and is not an *adulteress*, even though she marries another man"** (Rom. 7:2,3). 

 > "**A woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives**. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but he must belong to the Lord" **(1 Cor. 7:39)**. 
 
 (2) You mentioned getting forgiven for "divorcing our spouses." Please know that there is no such thing in Scripture as getting forgiven from the *sin of divorce*! This subtle twisting of the Word regarding getting forgiven over the sin of "divorce" has led some to go through with it, then remarry, **hence committing *adultery* themselves and causing their new "spouse" to become guilty of the same sin**. Without a doubt, in many cases, a *remarriage* is the world's term for what the Lord taught is **adultery**. *Remarriage* would be **adultery** in God's eyes because it is an unrecognized marriage as far as He is concerned. (A *remarriage* is justified when the spouse dies.)

**[READ MORE ABOUT: Adultery, Divorce And An Illegitimate Marriage](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ab.htm)**

 (3) When Jesus spoke of committing adultery over an illegitimate marriage, as cited in Matt. 5:32 and 19:9, a **CONTINUOUS-TENSE ADULTERY** is what would result. This would be impossible if one would illegitimately marry a person, then repent of his *sin of divorce* and an illegitimate marriage and go on as if it was now a marriage recognized by **[Almighty God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.html).**

## The Adulterous and Divorced, Herodias 

[![remarriage adultery return to first husband](../../files/pictures/remarriage-adultery-return-to-first-husband.png "Should she return to her first husband?")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christiansingles.html)

(4) **Whose wife was Herodias**? Please consider the following passage from Mk. 6:17, 18: 
> "For Herod himself had given orders to have John arrested, and he had him bound and put in prison. He did this because of Herodias, **his brother Philip's wife**, whom he had **married**. For John had been saying to Herod, 'It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.'" 

NOTE: **Even though Herod had "married" Herodias, she was still considered "Philip's wife."** That is why John said it was not lawful for him to have his brother's wife. In other words, ***adultery* was being committed by both Herodias and Herod.** 

(5) You say you are so much in love and desire to serve the Lord together as husband and wife. Such is an impossibility. Neither of you two will be recognized from God's perspective as bound together by Him as husband and wife! This statement, though it may seem hard, is the truth, based on Scripture. The best way for you two to serve the Lord is to begin by **stop entertaining the devil's [sexual temptation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sexualtemptation.htm)** that you two would like to get married. This is like two people saying "We want to rob a bank and then serve the Lord with the money." 

 **[PERSONAL TESTIMONY of Repentance From Remarriage Adultery](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance-from-remarriage-adultery.html)** 

 (6) To say you know of other "Christian couples" who are both *divorced and remarried* and have good solid marriages and serve the Lord is meaningless! To be guilty of ***adultery*** excludes one from being a real Christian. What other people have or don't have or do or don't do has nothing to do with us individually. We are to go by the Word of God regardless if anyone else goes by it or not. It seems like you are trying to find every possible reason to "marry" outside of the will of God to justify your desires, even to the point of looking at others who have done a similar evil thing. 

 **[Find Out How To Crucify The Flesh](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/crucify-the-flesh.html)** 

 There are **many** people, even in the "church," who are illegitimately married. Such are committing continuous **adultery** from God's perspective and really are not "Christian" as they may profess to be. **It is impossible to be a Christian and to be sexually immoral at the same time, in spite of what some are teaching. Do not be deceived: There is no such thing as once saved always saved, also known as eternal security or the perseverance of the saints. So if you think you can both divorce, then marry each other and be spiritually safe, based upon eternal security, you are Scripturally mistaken. The teaching of eternal security is a rampant heresy that has multitudes in danger of [Hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html) without such knowing they're in this type of danger.** [Please see our other information exposing and refuting the heresy of **[eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**, **[perseverance of the saints](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/perseverance-of-the-saints.htm)** or **[once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html).**] 

## A Wayward Wife or *Divorcee* Is NOT Single 

(7) **A wayward wife is called the adulteress**: 
> "It [wisdom] will save you also from the **adulteress, from the wayward wife** with her seductive words, who has **left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God**. For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead. **None who go to her** return or **attain the paths of life**. Thus you will walk in the ways of good men and keep to the paths of the righteous. For the upright will live in the land, and the blameless will remain in it; but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful will be torn from it" (Prov. 2:16-22). 

COMMENT: Please note, the adulteress in the above passage is really a **divorcee**, for she _left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God._ **Marriage is a covenant between two people and God.** Also, a "wayward wife" is called elsewhere in Scripture an **immoral person**, a **[prostitute](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/prostitution.htm)** and an **adulteress**:

> "For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the corrections of discipline are the way to life, keeping you from the **immoral woman**, from the smooth tongue of the **wayward wife**. Do not lust in your heart after her beauty or let her captivate you with her eyes, for the **prostitute** reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the **adulteress** preys upon your very life" (Prov. 6:23-26). 

Consider also the following Scripture which states that marriage is a _covenant_ before God:

> "You ask, 'Why?' It is because the LORD is acting as the witness between you and the wife of your youth, because you have broken faith with her, though **she is your partner, the wife of your marriage covenant**. Has not the LORD made them one? In flesh and spirit they are his. And why one? Because he was seeking godly offspring. So guard yourself in your spirit, and **do not break faith with the wife** of your youth. '**I hate divorce**,' says the LORD God of Israel, 'and I hate a man's covering himself with violence as well as with his garment,' says the LORD Almighty. So guard yourself in your spirit, and **do not break faith**" (Malachi 2:14-16).

As Scripture says elsewhere, what God has joined together, let not man separate:
> "So they are no longer two, but one. Therefore **what God has joined together, let man not separate**" (Matt. 19:6). 

Notice the rest of the dialogue:
> "'Why then,' they asked, 'did Moses command that a man give his wife a certificate of divorce and send her away?' Jesus replied, 'Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard. But it was not this way from the beginning. **I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery.'** The disciples said to him, '**If this is the situation between a husband and wife, it is better not to marry**.' Jesus replied, 'Not everyone can accept this word, but only those to whom it has been given. For some are eunuchs because they were born that way; others were made that way by men; and others have renounced marriage because of the kingdom of heaven. The one who can accept this should accept it.' " (Matt. 19:7-12).

This life is a test (Jam. 1:12; Rev. 2:10,11; 3:10) and that includes properly dealing with *divorce*. The stakes are eternal. **Only the minority will pass the test and enter through the narrow gate that leads to life (Matt. 7:13,14). The vast majority of people will be thrown into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15; 21:8).** Don't get yourself snared by an illegitimate marriage that may bring much temporal pleasure and comfort now, but reap an **eternal torment in fire** and great regret over such later:
> "What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his **soul**?" (Mk 8:36).

**Again, it is NOT always God's will to remarry, as 1 Cor. 7:11 clearly states. Ponder the apostle's teaching on this, under grace, if you are thinking about doing such:**
> "But and if she depart, LET HER REMAIN UNMARRIED, or be reconciled to her husband: and let not the husband put away his wife" (1 Cor. 7:11). 

Stay in the Bible and go by its counsel. Live in the fear of God. Think beyond the grave and ponder your own judgment before God. **No person, regardless how much you may be drawn to him or her, is worth going to eternal punishment over**. 

## Divorce *Except For Fornication* Exception Clause 

**The Lord Jesus taught on many touchy subjects. Among them all, *divorce and remarriage* being *adultery* is one of the most volatile, especially in our day when 50% or more marriages are ending in *divorce*. In fact, if one wanted to study divorce and remarriage for himself, he should also look up *adultery* in the Scriptures to learn what Jesus said about *divorce*!** In every case it is crystal clear, except twice (Mt. 5:32; 19:9). Both of those passages say "except for fornication." The same Greek word translated fornication (KJV) is also found in 1 Cor. 5:1 and refers to the incest (and ***adultery***) mentioned there. Hence, the word should be translated *sexual immorality*, since fornication in our day is understood differently and between two unmarried people.

**Many remarried people are resting their salvation on the sexual immorality of their former spouse, which they think has freed them through a *divorce* to remarry without being guilty of *adultery*, based on Mt. 5:32 and 19:9. How sound is that? To expand the possibility of what those verses are saying one should focus on Mt. 1:19:** 
 > Because Joseph her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her [Mary] to public disgrace, he had in mind to **divorce** her quietly. 

Joseph was planning on ***divorcing*** Mary. What is significant is, that was BEFORE they were actually married, that is, while they were only *pledged* (engaged) to be married (Mt. 1:18,19; Lk. 1:27)! Also, the same Greek word for *divorce* as found in Mt. 1:19 is also found in Mt. 5:32 and 19:9! **Could it be that only during that *engagement* time (as we would say in our day) is divorce permitted and that being only for *sexual immorality?* This could be the intended meaning of Mt. 5:32 and 19:9. If that is how we should understand Mt. 5:32 and 19:9, then there are no exceptions for divorce once a person does actually get married, as is clear in *the law of marriage* (Rom. 7:2,3) and even at 1 Cor. 7:39.** Please study this subject out for yourself, especially if it applies to your situation. Such a study could benefit your soul or the souls of your loved ones. This information is important for *Christian singles* to know, who are looking for a life-long godly spouse to serve God with.

[**Here Is Truth On *Christian Singles and Christian Dating***](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christiansingles.html) 

## S. Michael Houdmann Downplays *Adultery* 

There are multitudes of promenient teachers who will **downplay the LETHAL dangers of an *adulterous marriage***, one not recognized by God. Here is one by S. Michael Houdmann:

> **A divorced and/or remarried** believer should not feel any less loved by God, even if the divorce and/or remarriage is not covered under the possible exception clause of Matthew 19:9. **God often uses even the sinful disobedience of Christians to accomplish great good.** ([**S. Michael Houdmann**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/got-questions.html), What does the Bible say about divorce and remarriage, emphasis mine)

**In other words, heretics want us to believe an adulterous marriage is *sinful disobedience* (really *CONTINOUS TENSE ADULTERY*), but somehow *great good* can come out of it!** [Where does the Bible say great good comes out of *adultery.* That's what the devil wants us to believe.] Houdmann is also saying there are *Christian adulterers*, which fits his doctrine and contradicts 1 Cor. 6:9,10! Should we just trash what the Bible says and believe the multitude of teachers, like S. Michael Houdmann, who declare such garbage? GOD FORBID!

## Ministers Who Marry *Divorced* People Promote *Adultery* 

Ministers who "marry" two people that are not eligible for marriage, because of a past marriage, are helping to perpetuate this rampant problem with *adultery.* To teach contrary to the Scriptures on any issue of divorce and remarriage can stumble others and bring judgment down on the teacher(s):

 (a) They are causing another to commit adultery through their teachings: 
 > " 'But you have turned from the way and **by your teaching have caused many to stumble**' " (Mal. 2:8). 
 
 > Nevertheless, I have this against you: You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. **By her teaching she misleads my servants into sexual immorality** and the eating of food sacrificed to idols. (Rev 2:20) 

 (b) Such ministers would also be indited by Lk. 17:1-3:
 > "Jesus said to his disciples: '**Things that cause people to sin** are bound to come, but **woe to that person through whom they come**. It would be better for him to be thrown into the sea with a millstone tied around his neck than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin. **So watch yourselves**.' " 

## Jeopardizing The Entire Fold - Spreading *ADULTERY* 

(c) For ministers to have known illegitimately married couples, that is adulterers as God sees them, in their folds and to extend the right hand of Christian fellowship toward them, is to jeopardize the spiritual well-being of the entire congregation:
> "Don't you know that **a little yeast works through the whole batch of dough**? Get rid of the old yeast that you may be a new batch without yeast--as you really are" (1 Cor. 5:6, 7). 

 Christians are commanded **under grace** not to associate with or even to eat with a person who is sexually immoral (which includes *adultery*) and claims to be a Christian:
 > "But now I am writing you that **you must not associate** with **anyone who calls himself a brother but is sexually immoral** or greedy, an idolater or a slanderer, a drunkard or a swindler. **With such a man do not even eat**" (1 Cor. 5:11). 
 
 **Ministry is not a popularity contest.** A true shepherd is to preach the truth, and guard the sheep that have been entrusted to him, even if it is unpopular as it was for **[John the Baptist](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john_the_baptist.htm).**
 
## IF You Are In An *Adulterous* Marriage 

**If you are now convinced from the Scriptures that you are in an _adulterous_ so-called _marriage_, please know it is _adulterous_ because it is NOT recognized by God as a marriage to him. Man might refer to it as a _marriage_, but God sees it as _adultery_ for both parties because it isn't legitimate. To God, it is not different from two people _living together_ who would never claim to be married and who are having sexual union! They are continuing in sexual immorality, just like it is a continuous state of adultery, which is being committed by people who are not married in God's sight.**

Since the two people in an adulterous so-called marriage are NOT married, if they went their own separate ways it could not be _divorce_ in God's eyes, since they were never married in God's eyes, only in man's eyes. In man's eyes, _divorce_ would result from such, but that is not the issue here. The issue is _**how does God** view two people in an adulterous marriage?_ 

If the same two people in an _adulterous marriage_ live under the same roof as brother and sister **with no sexual contact,** would that be acceptable to God? Some think it might be. One thing is certain, **their sexual contact is _adultery_ to God and that will send them to the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8; 1 Cor. 6:9,10; etc.) unless they get forgiven and stop all sexual union (adultery). Don't be deceived by [John MacArthur ministries](http://www.eternallifeblog.com/john-macarthur-adulterous-marriage/) which also downplays such _adultery!_**

## 1 Cor. 7:1-5 Passage Does Not Apply > To An Adulterous Marriage 

**Since two people in an *adulterous marriage* are not married in God's eyes, the 1 Cor. 7:1-5 passage referring to *married people* does NOT apply. The sexual union for them must stop for it is *adultery* and therefore forbidden because the marriage is in name only. It is not a bonafide marriage before God.** Don't be deceived by the multitude of ear-ticklers, who downplay the adultery in an adulterous marriage. Be on your guard. Your SOUL is your most valuable possession.

## It is NOT Merciful To Deceive About Divorce and Remarriage 

Though it might sound like the message of the Lord Jesus about divorce and remarriage being adultery is *too harsh for our day,* it is relevant and true mercy because it is based on God's truth and spiritual reality. Remember this: **a false teacher is DANGEROUS, especially when teaching on any subject connected with salvation. In fact, he can be your worst enemy, though he may seem compassionate, caring and lenient. A false teacher is NOT ultimately concerned about your SOUL! He is more concerned about himself and keeping his own congregation and/or ministry! Chances are he has a mortgage or a car payment! For some it might just be his teaching influence over a large number he is thinking about!** With over 50% of the professing Christians in the American churches being divorced and remarried, the typical *pastor* of our day will be reluctant, at best, to repeat Jesus' teaching on divorce and remarriage, but his negligence doesn't change Jesus' message! Don't be deceived. Learn the truth about [repentance and forgiveness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html). God's word is [final authority](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html). **Your eternal destiny depends on what you do with that message! NO sin or person is worth going to hell over.** GOD BLESS YOU.

Folks, **don't marry a *divorced* person whose spouse is still alive! Such a *divorce and remarriage equals adultery*.**
