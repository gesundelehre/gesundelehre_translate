<img src="../../files/pictures/TDOR.Pic.4(72).jpg" alt="Copyrighted. All sex outside a legitimate marriage in God's sight will send you to Hell" />

In part, the wickedness of our world (even in the present professing _church_) is reflected by its unbiblical views on premarital _safe sex_. This present wicked society, which has been adversely influenced by TV, music and the public schools, embraces the view: _if you want to be sexually active do it, but protect yourself from disease and unwanted pregnancy._ A recent newspaper article which interviewed mostly high school students and some grown ups about sex before marriage reads as follows:

> **It’s not wrong to have sex with someone if you’re planning on staying with them** .... If you think that you are ready, **go for it.**
> 
> If that’s what you want to do, that’s what you want to do.
> 
> **Your friends help you figure out what is right and wrong.**

Besides the above, a different person who is both religious and deceived, stated:

> **God** is the main authority. **Not that he’ll zap you when you are out of line**. He puts ideas of right **and wrong** into you.

Two different beguiled mothers said regarding sex before marriage:

> What is right for you might not be right for me.
> 
> We tell him [their 17 year old son], **as far as our religion, that it’s wrong. But it’s good for us to be realistic**. Kids are getting married older and older.


## Doesn't God's _Love_ Protect Us From Hell?

One religious leader who accurately mentioned that the Bible says to _flee sexual immorality,_ afterwards made allowances for it by misrepresenting the _love of God._ He declared those who yield to this sinful temptation are still being **_loved_** the same by God:

> God doesn’t love you any less.

Sadly, if that same person knew the truth he didn’t declare it, that is, that **God sends people to [hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html) that he _loves_**. He further didn’t mention that **the real issue isn’t if God loves us or not, but if we love God or not.** This is a _**salvation**_ issue and nothing less:

> However, as it is written: "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived **what God has prepared for those who love him**" (1 Cor 2:9)
> 
> Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to inherit **the kingdom he promised those who love him?** (James 2:5)

Furthermore, only those who **[_obey_ God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/obey.html)** _love_ God:

> If you **love me, you will obey what I command**. (John 14:15)
> 
> Whoever has **my commands and obeys them,** he is the one who **loves me.** He who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I too will love him and show myself to him. (John 14:21)
> 
> **This is love for God: to obey his commands.** And his **commands are not burdensome.** (1 John 5:3)

The world also wants us to think God’s holy commands are obsolete and _burdensome,_ but that is just another lie. They are neither.


## Who's _Judging_!

In this newspaper article those who are _abstaining_ are described as _**not pass[ing] judgment** on those that have chosen otherwise._ This is another area of great confusion. People wrongly tend to label one who is declaring the eternal message of God as _judging,_ when they aren’t. They are merely stating the facts, according to God’s word. **It is God who said the sexually immoral will _not inherit his kingdom,_ but will go to _the lake of fire_ (unless they repent).**


## _Eternal Security_ - A License for Immorality

How anyone can argue against the fact that a belief in **[eternal security leads to wickedness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** is beyond me, especially with all of the actual testimonies that are available through our ministry. Beyond these testimonies, in the same newspaper already quoted, is what a young girl dangerously stated about yielding to sexual immorality:

> My religion has been a big factor in my decision [to abstain from sex before marriage]. I would like to wait, but nothing is carved in stone. But **if I don’t I am not going to go to Hell** or anything .... **I was questioning last week why am I doing this** [abstaining from sex before marriage].

![](../../files/pictures/dontgotohell.gif)

That deceived religious girl’s **statement about not going to _hell,_ if she would fornicate, suggests a belief in eternal security - a popular [doctrine of demons](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/doctrine-of-demons.html)**. May that same young woman, and all the others who practice _abstaining_ but think they are forever safe from the flames of hell, ponder the Scriptural facts about **_all_** sexually immoral people. Unequivocally, the word of God says the immoral are spiritually _dead and lost_ while in such **[sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html)**, **even if they were once _saved._** The following three passages were addressed to those who had already been _born again_ and **warns even them of the dangers of hell [or _not inheriting the kingdom of God_].**

> For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person - such a man is an idolater - has any **inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words,** for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them. (Eph 5:5-7)
> 
> The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this **[will not inherit the kingdom of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/will-not-inherit-the-kingdom-of-God.htm).** (Gal 5:19-21)
> 
> **Do you not know that the wicked will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived:** Neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters nor adulterers nor male prostitutes nor homosexuals nor thieves nor the greedy nor drunkards nor slanderers nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. (1 Cor 6:9,10)


## _Safe Sex_ For Christians?

**[John Ankerberg](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ankerber.htm)** is an **[eternal security teacher](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html)**. Notice the version of _safe sex_ that this horrendous teaching has produced:

> **Christians will not be judged eternally for their sins**. The penalty for all their sins was fully paid for by Jesus Christ at the cross .... But Christians may still **lose rewards** in heaven. **Indeed, we can only wonder what some Christians will feel like and experience on that day when they lose those heavenly rewards because of the spiritually numbing and other consequences of fornication or adultery while on earth? It will certainly be an infinitely poor exchange - losing eternal rewards in heaven for a few fleeting moments of sexual pleasure on earth.**

John Ankerberg’s message is another way of saying **you can go out and fornicate and commit adultery if you were ever saved and you won’t go to hell - the crux of eternal security and what the devil wants Christians to believe. Hence, both the world system and eternal security teachers have their versions of _safe sex_ with limited risks. They both deny the real ultimate danger of sexual immorality - getting thrown into _the lake of fire._**

Also, we should never forget that the **[prodigal son](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/prodigal-son.html)** was spiritually _dead and lost_ while sexually immoral:

> For this son of mine **was dead** and is alive again; he **was lost** and is found. So they began to celebrate. (Luke 15:24)

He didn’t become _**alive again** _[that is, **saved _again_**] and _**found**_ until after he turned from such wickedness and returned to the Father to humbly serve him. Though **[savage wolves in sheep's clothing](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm)** teach otherwise, facts are facts as disturbing as they may be to some. This is God’s declaration on _wild living._

Multitudes in our day are dangerously deceived and on the road to hell, even though these relevant passages say _don’t be deceived_ or the like. May many of the same read this very article and turn from their sins **which are dragging them to hell’s raging fires:**

> But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the **sexually immoral,** those who practice **[magic arts](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/occult.html)**, the idolaters and all liars - **their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur**. This is the second death. (Rev 21:8)


## _Wise_ or _Foolish_?

Jesus often spoke of two types of people. In Mt. 7:24-27, the _wise_ builder is distinguished from the _foolish_ builder because he put into practice the word of God and obeyed. Therefore, the _wise_ single (or married) Christian is the person obeying God, **[crucifying the flesh](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/crucify-the-flesh.html)** and walking in the fear of God, because he knows **he can yet go to hell.** One must have _a pure heart_ to see God (Mt. 5:8).

**Finally, please know that _any form of sexual immorality,_ before or after marriage, will send YOU to hell and therefore cannot be _safe sex_ in the truest sense! YOU must repent before it is eternally too late.** See other related articles at
