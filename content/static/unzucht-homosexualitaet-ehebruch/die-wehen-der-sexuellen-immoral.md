**_Sexual immorality_ is different from all other sins. The devil as a convincing and enticing _liar_ uses sexual immorality whenever he can! He also only has your _worst_ in mind as he tries to lure you away from God and into sexual sin. He knows what sexual immorality can do to your _soul_.** When the _liar_ comes tempting with deadly sin, especially _sexual immorality,_ he portrays it as something far from reality. **He never will give the full picture including the _guilt, shame, [spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)_ and _pain_ that come afterwards.** If he did, no one would ever fall prey to his temptations.



## If I Could Only Turn Back The Hands Of Time

What you are about to read are actual emails that have been written by those deceived into committing **_sexual immorality._** Note the _bitter pain, regret_ and _questions_ afterwards. If only they could **_turn back the hands of time_** they would not have yielded to the devil.  Remember what this sin brought to them and learn from their experiences:

● I have been sexually immoral. I guess I am spiritually dead now and **I do feel bad spiritually sick that is**. Can I come back to life and be spiritually healthy again?

● Please help me to overcome **my guilt** of having a one night stand with a divorced woman. I myself am a single guy. Never been married. But she was married twice and divorced twice. We stop seeing each other after the one night stand.**I regret it ever since, but my conscious is still bothering me. I feel so ashamed and guilt because of my lack of self control at that time. Help me. I hate myself for becoming a stumbling block to her and myself.** I am a believer. **I repented of it. but yet the thought still lingers in my mind. **Also, does that make me an adulterer? Even though I am not married. Yet had a sexual encounter to a divorced woman Would that make me a fornicator or adulterer or both? **I apologized to her and prayed with her to forgive me. I asked God to forgive me and her for this sin.** Never again have i contacted her. Will God judge me even though i sinned and apologized. **I despised myself for it.**


## Sexual Immorality Is Unique

The Bible explicitly states that _sexual sin_ is uniquely worse than other types of sin—it is a sin against one’s **_own body_:

> Flee from sexual immorality. **All other sins a man commits are outside his body, but he who sins sexually sins against his own body.** (1 Cor 6:18)

The Bible advises Christians to **_flee sexual immorality_ for good reason. **Sexual sin will also drag one to _hell_, unless the sinner gets forgiven, cleansed and changed:

> **For of this you can be sure: No immoral, impure or greedy person—such a man is an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God. Let no one deceive you with empty words,** for because of such things God’s wrath comes on those who are disobedient. Therefore do not be partners with them. (Eph 5:5-7)

As you just read, sexual immorality is a sin against one’s **_own body_** and** _will drag one to hell._** Proverbs gives us other details:

> For these commands are a lamp, this teaching is a light, and the corrections of discipline are the way to life, keeping you from **the immoral woman**, from the smooth tongue of the wayward wife. Do not **[lust in your heart after her beauty](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lust.html)** or let her captivate you with her eyes, for the prostitute **reduces you to a loaf of bread, and the adulteress preys upon your very life. Can a man scoop fire into his lap without his clothes being burned? Can a man walk on hot coals without his feet being scorched? So is he who sleeps with another man’s wife; no one who touches her will go unpunished.**  (Prov 6:23-29)

> It will save you also from **the adulteress**, from the wayward wife with her seductive words, who has left the partner of her youth and ignored the covenant she made before God. **For her house leads down to death and her paths to the spirits of the dead. None who go to her return or attain the paths of life.** (Prov 2:16-19)

> For the lips of an **adulteress** drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil; but **in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave.** She gives no thought to the way of life; her paths are crooked, but she knows it not. Now then, my sons, listen to me; do not turn aside from what I say. **Keep to a path far from her, do not go near the door of her house, lest you give your best strength to others and your years to one who is cruel, lest strangers feast on your wealth and your toil enrich another man’s house. At the end of your life you will groan, when your flesh and body are spent.** You will say, “How I hated discipline! How my heart spurned correction! I would not obey my teachers or listen to my instructors. **I have come to the brink of utter ruin** in the midst of the whole assembly.” (Prov 5:3-14)

> Why be captivated, my son, by an **adulteress**? Why embrace the bosom of **another man’s wife**? For a man’s ways are in full view of the LORD, and he examines all his paths. **The evil deeds of a wicked man ensnare him; the cords of his sin hold him fast. He will die for lack of discipline, led astray by his own great folly.** (Prov 5:20-23)

The **_adulteress_** is also spoken of here:

> With persuasive words she led him astray; she seduced him with her smooth talk. All at once **he followed her like an ox going to the slaughter, like a deer stepping into a noose till an arrow pierces his liver, like a bird darting into a snare, little knowing it will cost him his life.** Now then, my sons, listen to me; pay attention to what I say. Do not let your heart turn to her ways or stray into her paths. **Many are the victims she has brought down; her slain are a mighty throng. Her house is a highway to the grave, leading down to the chambers of death**. (Prov 7:21-27)

## A Deep Pit

Notice the words of an adulteress and who gets deceived by her. Also, note her attitude regarding her own wickedness.

> The mouth of an adulteress is a **deep pit**; he who is under the Lord’s wrath will fall into it. (Prov 22:14)

> This is the way of an adulteress: She eats and wipes her mouth and says, **“I’ve done nothing wrong.**” (Prov 30:20)

The truth is though she thinks she has done _nothing wrong,_ she has done enough wrong to merit _**eternal fire._  She is going to the _fiery lake of burning sulfur_ and taking others to the _fiery lake of burning sulfur_ with her:**

> But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the **sexually immoral,** those who practice magic arts, the idolaters and all liars —**their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur.** This is the second death. (Rev 21:8)

She and her victims must _repent and faithfully follow Jesus to the end_ or be _**damned._**



## The Prodigal and King David's Sexual Immorality Brought Regret and Pain

The **[prodigal son](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/prodigal-son.html)** is a sad example of a person with salvation, who strayed away from God and became spiritually **_dead_** and **_lost_** because of sin. Among his various sins was **_sexual immorality._ His life was ruined and wasted by sin.**  What he thought would bring him happiness and joy brought **_regret, emptiness _and _spiritual death._** He is an example of a person who had a great fall, wisely repented, then humbly came back home to serve God.

Another person who knew about **sexual immorality and the _misery, shame, regret, other sins that follow_ and _spiritual death_ it brings** was David. Read his remorseful words and ponder them carefully:

> For I know my transgressions, and **my sin is always before me.** (Psa 51:3)

> **Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquity. Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me from your presence or take your Holy Spirit from me.** (Psa 51:9-11)

**Save me from bloodguilt,** O God, the God who saves me, and my tongue will sing of your righteousness. (Psa 51:14)

> Because of your wrath there is no health in my body; my bones have no soundness **because of my sin.** My **guilt** has overwhelmed me like a burden too heavy to bear. My wounds fester and are loathsome **because of my sinful folly.** I am bowed down and brought very low; all day long I go about mourning. My back is filled with searing pain; there is **no health in my body. I am feeble and utterly crushed; I groan in anguish of heart.** All my longings lie open before you, O Lord; my sighing is not hidden from you. My heart pounds, my strength fails me; even the light has gone from my eyes. **My friends and companions avoid me** because of my wounds; my neighbors stay far away. Those who seek my life set their traps, those who would harm me talk of my ruin; all day long they plot deception. I am like a deaf man, who cannot hear, like a mute, who cannot open his mouth; I have become like a man who does not hear, whose mouth can offer no reply. (Psa 38:3-14)

> When I kept silent, my bones wasted away through my groaning all day long. For day and night your hand was heavy upon me; my strength was sapped as in the heat of summer. Selah Then I acknowledged my sin to you and did not cover up my iniquity. I said, “I will confess my transgressions to the LORD”—and you forgave the guilt of my sin. Selah (Psa 32:3-5)

To make matters worse for David, the following judgment was pronounced upon him:

> “Why did you despise the word of the LORD by doing what is evil in his eyes? You struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and took his wife to be your own. You killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. Now, therefore, **the sword will never depart from your house**, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.” This is what the LORD says: **“Out of your own household I am going to bring calamity upon you. Before your very eyes I will take your wives and give them to one who is close to you, and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight.** You did it in secret, but I will do this thing in broad daylight before all Israel.” (2 Sam 12:9-12)

The wages of sin is **_death_** (Rom. 6:23).This holds true all throughout this life—both before and after getting _born again._ See Rom. 8:13; James 5:19,20; etc. **_Sexual immorality_ will drag multitudes more to the lake of fire**. To enter God’s kingdom you will have to be _self controlled_ in this area or you will not enter. Your regret beyond the grave will be throughout eternity as you are tormented in raging fire with no hope of getting out:

> **Be self-controlled and alert.** Your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion **looking for someone to devour. Resist him, standing firm in the faith,** because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kind of sufferings. (1 Pet 5:8,9)

**Think about eternity. [Crucify the flesh](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/crucify-the-flesh.html) and resist sexual sin. Remember the woes and regrets of sexual immorality sin for your own good.**
