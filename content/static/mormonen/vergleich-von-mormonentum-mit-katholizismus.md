## Mormonism
*   claims itself to uniquely be "the Church"
*   claims a unique and authoritative priesthood, thereby denying the royal priesthood of all believers
*   adds to the Holy Bible (with the **[Book of Mormon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon-1.html)**, Doctrine and Covenants and Pearl of Great Price)
*   accepts multiple satanic visions as being from God
*   undermines the power of Jesus' blood by its view of personal suffering for the expiation of sins
*   sings praise songs about **[Joseph Smith, Jr.](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormons.html)**
*   has strange doctrines regarding marriage (polygamy accepted in early days)
*   believes in God the mother (who has conceived multitudes of spirit children)
*   claims the head of their group speaks infallibly at times
*   redefines "saint" to mean a living, breathing Mormon, instead of a bible-defined child of God
*   accepts and spreads "another gospel" (Gal. 1:8,9)- good works, water baptism and church membership
*   professes itself as Christian; Jesus as God, Savior, Lord and Son of God; Jesus' atoning death and resurrection
*   doctrines are sending millions to Hell and they need to be openly refuted with Scripture


## Catholicism

*   claims a unique and authoritative priesthood, thereby denying the royal priesthood of all believers
*   adds to the **[Holy Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)** (with sacred tradition)
*   accepts multiple satanic visions as being from God
*   undermines the power of **[Jesus' blood](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesusblood.html)** by its view of personal suffering for the expiation of sins
*   sings praise songs about Mary
*   has strange doctrines regarding marriage (celibacy still practiced among its clergy)
*   believes in the **[mother of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/motherofgod.html)** (who is the sinless Queen of Heaven)
*   claims the head of their group speaks infallibly at times
*   redefines "saint" to mean a physically dead Catholic who was afterwards "canonized," instead of a bible-defined child of God
*   accepts and spreads "another gospel" (Gal. 1:8,9) - good works, the sacraments, **[Mary](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mary.html)** and church membership
*   professes itself as Christian; Jesus as God, Savior, Lord and Son of God; Jesus' atoning death and resurrection
*   doctrines are sending hundreds of millions to **[Hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternaltorment.html)** and they need to be openly refuted with Scripture
*   teaches and practices bowing before and kissing statues
*   WORSHIPS the consecrated communion wafer as God
*   claims Mary is their life, sweetness, hope and most gracious advocate (as revealed in the Rosary)
*   claims Mary was raised bodily into Heaven
*   claims they get to Jesus by first going to Mary

Countercult ministries and church congregations across the United States need to be commended for their love and concern for Mormons, as they refute their strange and spiritually dangerous doctrines with Scripture and logic.

**However, when it comes to Roman Catholicism, this same concern is missing, primarily because Catholicism teaches the Trinity doctrine! Have you ever noticed there is never a Scripture cited to single out this doctrine, though true, as being the major consideration in identifying a religious system as being false and non-Christian or not?**

On the other hand, the plan of salvation (the gospel message) is elevated in Scripture as being of "first importance" (1 Cor. 15:3). Paul wrote:

> Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved, if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received I passed on to you as of FIRST IMPORTANCE (1 Cor. 15:1-3).

Also, it is evident from Acts 15:1-3 and the book of Galatians that the one and only plan of salvation was singled out by Paul as the doctrine to be stressed. Gal. 1:8,9 read:

> But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach a GOSPEL other than the one we preached to you, let him be eternally condemned! As we have already said, so now I say again: If anybody is preaching to you a GOSPEL other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!

It can be assumed that these false teachers that Paul wrote of in Galatians accepted the **[Trinity](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/trinity.html)** doctrine, since he had no disagreement with their doctrine about God! However, Paul stood steadfastly against them and their teaching in his effort to please God and not man (Gal. 1:10).

Reader, if your primary goal is the same as Paul's, should you not likewise be speaking out in love against the strange and spiritually dangerous doctrines of Roman Catholicism, especially their false **[plan of salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)**, which is no real plan of salvation at all? Just like the Mormons, the Catholics continue to stumble over the stumbling stone (Rom. 9:30;10:4) and they need help.

<span style="BACKGROUND: #FFFF00">**The victim of this inconsistency from countercult ministries is the sincere **[Catholic](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html)** in the pew who has a heart to receive the truth, but never hears it because he belongs to a religious system which teaches the Trinity. As a consequence, he remains lost because he doesn't know the real plan of salvation - repentance towards God and faith in Christ Jesus (Acts 20:21).**</span>
