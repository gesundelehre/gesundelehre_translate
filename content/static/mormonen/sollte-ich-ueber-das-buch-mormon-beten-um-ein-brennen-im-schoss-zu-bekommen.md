## Mormon Missionaries Want You To Pray About 
The Book Of Mormon For a _Burning In The Bosom_



[![Should I Pray About The Book Of Mormon and burning in the bosom? NO! The devil can give me that feeling!](../../files/pictures/mormon-wondering.jpg "Should I Pray About The Book Of Mormon and burning in the bosom? NO! The devil can give me that feeling!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon-1.html)

<big>**[Ask The Mormon Missionaries These Questions](#burning%20in%20the%20bosom)**</big> 

**_Should you pray about the Book of Mormon?_ That is an important issue that will come up if you have ever dialoged with or witnessed to a Mormon. If you have, it usually isn’t too long before they want you to _pray about the Book of Mormon_ and for the _testimony of the Holy Spirit_.** They refer us to a passage in the Book of Mormon which is Moroni 10:4:


## Moroni 10:4

> "And when ye shall receive these things, I would exhort you that ye would ask God, the Eternal Father, in the name of Christ, if these things are not true; and if ye shall **ask with a sincere heart, with real intent**, having faith in Christ, he will **manifest the truth of it unto you, by the power of the Holy Ghost."**

Sometimes the Mormon missionaries will supplement Moroni 10:4 with a Doc. & Cov.9:8, which says:


## Doctrine and Covenants 9:8

> "But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then **you must ask me if it be right,** and if it is right I will cause that **your bosom shall burn within you;** therefore, you shall feel that it is right."

[![burning in the bosom](../../files/pictures/book-of-mormon.jpg "book of mormon is NOT from God")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon-1.html)

**Again, Mormon missionaries will use that Moroni passage from the Book of Mormon to try to get the potential convert to _pray about_ the Book of Mormon.** Doesn’t _praying about_ something, including the Book of Mormon, sound good? It seems on the surface to be a completely safe thing to do, but is it really, or can the innocent be misled by such? The Mormons often say something similar to this email from a Latter Day Saint:

> It is truly amazing what a loving God will reveal to those who **humble themselves and ask with a sincere heart and real intent!**

Please note they like to use the word _sincere_, which is their cop out before those who dangerously and wrongfully _pray about the Book of Mormon_, but experience nothing, that is, **they receive no so-called _burning in the bosom_ and _testimony of the Holy Spirit_.** The implication is _you weren’t really sincere. If you were, you would have received this_ (supposed) _testimony of the Holy Spirit._


## Is The _Testimony of the Holy Spirit_ (Burning In The Bosom) In The Bible

Sometimes the Mormons will also misuse Bible passages for confirmation about praying to see if you get that special _burning in the bosom_ (or witness of the Holy Spirit)

> And beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he [Jesus] explained to them what was said in all the Scriptures concerning himself. As they approached the village to which they were going, Jesus acted as if he were going farther. But they urged him strongly, “Stay with us, for it is nearly evening; the day is almost over.” So he went in to stay with them. When he was at the table with them, he took bread, gave thanks, broke it and began to give it to them. Then their eyes were opened and they recognized him, and he disappeared from their sight. They asked each other, “**Were not our hearts burning** within us while he talked with us on the road and opened the Scriptures to us?” (Luke 24:27-32)

As one Mormon wrote regarding that passage:

> Are you familiar with Luke 24:27-32? As Christ expounds the scriptures concerning himself, the Holy Spirit testifies of the truths He is speaking.

Did you notice the differences between what the Mormon suggested about _evidence for the Book of Mormon_ from that passage and what the disciples experienced, as cited in Luke 24:27-32? Please note the following: (1) They were already in the true faith before getting that _burning_; (2) The disciples didn't _pray about_ anything before getting that _burning,_ not one thing, (3) The _burning_ came after Jesus taught about himself from the Old Testament (Moses and all the Prophets). **Hence, there absolutely is no connection between Lk. 24:27-32 and praying about the book of mormon -- the LDS Scripture associated with a _Bible-defined false prophet_ ([Joseph Smith](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormons.html)).**


## The _Mormon Challenge_ To Pray About The Book of Mormon

The same Mormon followed up with this _Mormon challenge:_

> Again, **I challenge you**. Are you affraid [sic] that God will answer you [sic] prayers and that you will have to change you [sic] thinking to His. His thoughts and words are higher than ours you know. ...he [the devil] can not duplicate the peace and joy that come from a witness from the Holy Spirit—from God. Throughout the Scriptures, when someone had an experience with God, there was NO ROOM FOR MISINTERPRETATION. Ask! Seek! Knock! **I challenge you** (Capital emphasis his).

**They will try to apply the _pressure_, such as revealed there! Get ready for it.**


## <a name="burning%20in%20the%20bosom"></a>A Christian Should Respond to the _Mormon Challenge_ With These Questions

**How should a Christian respond to the Mormon _challenge_ to _pray about_ evidence for the Book of Mormon and the _testimony of the Holy Spirit?_** You can ask them the following questions: (a) Have you ever prayed about the Koran, the Jehovah’s Witness Bible or Avesta? (b) Have you prayed about bowing before a Mary statue or reciting the **[rosary](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/rosary.html)?** (c) Should you pray about robbing a bank and giving the money to the poor?

**The obvious answer is, _there is no need to pray about anything that is not Biblical and is outside of God’s will,_ including all of those**. Because these things are unbiblical, if God would answer that prayer, it would always be in accord with His written word. But to ask God in prayer something he has already spoken about can be _testing God,_ which is also forbidden.

**Remember also that Paul never asked any potential converts to _pray about_ his message**. What he taught was found in the Scriptures and they could verify it and join the group of _wise_ people, if they would **[repent](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)** and submissively place their faith in Jesus Christ to follow him. See Acts 17:11,12 cf. Acts 20:21; etc.

Again, be on your guard. To pray about something like the Book of Mormon (the LDS Bible) or bowing before a Mary statue can allow the **[devil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html)** to give you an _experience_ that will deceive you. A _burning in the bosom_ from such would not be _the testimony of the Holy Spirit,_ as the Latter Day Saint people like to say/think. **This is very important to remember and tell others about.**

**One of my family members _prayed about_ the [Jehovah's Witnesses](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html) and got _a burning in the bosom_ about that false religion. Is God giving the burning in the bosom experience to the Mormons and people who pray about the Jehovah’s Witnesses too? It would be impossible because these two beliefs are poles apart from each other. (These facts would also be good to share with the Mormon missionaries when they get emphatic about you praying about the Book of Mormon.) Do you remember what the aforementioned Mormon wrote about _peace and joy_ from the Holy Spirit? In part he wrote:**

> **... he [the devil] can not duplicate the _peace and joy_ that come from a witness from the Holy Spirit from God.**


## Is The Devil Deceiving People About LDS Scripture

Again the Mormons, like many others, are wrong about this. **Yes, the devil can duplicate _peace_**. That is what he does in transcendental meditation (TM) and also in **[Catholicism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html)** after one receives the _**[Eucharist](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eucharist.htm)**_. The devil uses these and other experiences to deceive. Please remember this: **Any experience, testimony, [dream](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dreams.htm), vision, prophecy, teaching, etc. that is supposed to be from God but doesn’t align itself with the [Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html) is _not from God_ at all**. The devil can and has used all of the above.

**Go by the Bible alone and be safe.** 2 Tim. 3:16,17 tells us that the man of God (Christian) is _thoroughly equipped for every good work_ **with the Scriptures (the Bible) alone.** Remember the **[Book of Mormon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon-1.html)** is not _another testament of Jesus Christ_, but is counterfeit Scripture similar to the Koran and like the perverted **[Jehovah's Witness Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/nwt.html)** (_The New World Translation)_.

Remember **the evidence** states the Latter Day Saint church and their LDS Scriptures are not of God. **We, therefore, don’t lack _wisdom_ about the Book of Mormon or Mormonism itself**. Remember those truths when **[witnessing to Mormons](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormon.html).** (So if they mention James 1:5 about _any man lacking wisdom_, answer as just cited.) It is not only futile to pray about the Book of Mormon it is also _dangerous,_ for it can open a person up to a Satanic deception. The devil can give you a _burning in the bosom_ and has done so to deceive precious souls.
