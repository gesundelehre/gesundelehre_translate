## Dies Sind Tatsächliche Glaubensvorstellungen Der Modernen HLT!

**The Mormon church or Latter Day Saints (LDS) has many non-Mormons deceived about their own _LDS beliefs_. When the mannerly, clean-cut Mormon missionaries come to our doors, the following is what they believe, but won't readily divulge to the new, potential converts. What you are about to read comes from some of the most authoritative sources in Mormonism about their own _LDS beliefs._**

[![himmlische Heirat HLT Glaubensvorstellungen](../../files/pictures/celestial-marriage-mormonism.jpg "himmlische Heirat HLT Glaubensvorstellungen")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon.htm)

**Alle der folgenden Zitate sind unbiblisch und daher nicht-Christlich.** Diese Zitate stammen von den Büchern betitelt mit (1) _Mormon Doctrine,_ von Bruce R. McConkie und veröffentlicht von Bookcraft (Salt Lake City, Utah) in 1966 und (2) _Articles of Faith_ von James E. Talmage, veröffentlicht von Deseret Book Co. (Salt Lake City, Utah) in 1988\. Das erste Buch wird durch MD abgekürzt und das letztere AOF. Falls du ein nicht-Mormone bist, der nicht vertraut ist mit den Glaubensvorstellungen der HLT, schnalle dich selbst an während du die Wahrheit darüber lernen wirst, was die Mormonenkirche glaubt! [Alles Fett hervorgehobene ist von mir, sofern nicht anders angegeben.]


## Der Vater, Sohn und Heiliger Geist sind Drei Götter:

> **Es gibt drei _Götter_ - der Vater, Sohn, und Heiliger Geist** - who, though separate in personality, are united as one in purpose, in plan, and in all the attributes of perfection (MD, p. 317).
> 
> **Drei separate Persönlichkeiten - Vater, Sohn und Heiliger Geist - bilden die Gottheit. Da jede dieser Personen ein GOtt ist,** ist es offensichtlich, von diesem Standpunkt alleine, dass eine _Vielzahl von Göttern_ existiert (MD, p. 576).

[](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ldsabomination.htm)


## [Das Ist Der Grund, Warum HLT Glaubensvorstellungen schlussfolgern, dass _ALLE Nicht Mormonischen Credo Ein Gräuel Sind_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ldsabomination.htm)


## Die 144'000 die in der Offenbarung erwähnt werden, sind alle Götter:

> At his Second Coming, "the Lamb shall stand upon Mount Zion, and with him _a hundred and forty-four thousand,_ having his Father's name written on their foreheads" .... **These 144,000 are Gods** .... (MD, p. 546).


## Gott der Vater war einst ein Mensch:

> All men in pre-existence were the _spirit children_ of **God our Father, an exalted, glorified, and perfected Man** (MD, p. 751).
> 
> **[Joseph Smith](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormons.html)** said: **"God himself was once as we are now, and is an exalted man**, and sits enthroned in yonder heavens! ... I am going to tell you **_how God came to be God._ We have imagined and supposed that God was God from all eternity. I will refute that idea, and take away the veil, so that you may see** .... (MD, p. 321).


## Der Himmlische Vater hat einen Körper aus Fleisch und Knochen:

> Therefore we know that both the Father and the Son are in form and stature perfect men; **each of them possesses a tangible body**, infinitely pure and perfect and attended by transcendent glory, nevertheless **a body of flesh and bones** (AOF, p. 38).


## Gott der Vater hatte einen Vater:

> ...**there is _"a God above the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ_ .... Hence if Jesus had a Father, can we not believe that _he_ had a Father also?"** (MD, p. 322).


## Es gibt auch eine Himmlische Mutter, die auch eine Gottheit ist:

> Implicit in the Christian verity that all men are the spirit children of an _Eternal Father_ is the usually unspoken truth that they are also the **offspring of an _Eternal Mother_** .... that man is the "offspring of _celestial parentage_," and that "all men and women are in the similitude of the _universal Father and **Mother,** _and are literally **the sons and daughters** of **Deity** (MD, p. 516).


## Christus wurde NICHT von einer Jungfrau geboren:

> Christ was begotten by an Immortal Father **in the same way that mortal men are begotten by mortal fathers** (MD, p. 547).


## Jesus Christus ist beides der Vater und der Sohn:

> Behold, I am Jesus Christ. **I am the Father and the Son** (AOF, p. 75).


## Gott lebt auf dem Planeten Kolob:

> **_Kolob_ **means "the first creation." It is the name of **the planet** "nearest to the celestial, or **the residence of God**" (MD, p. 428).


## Eternal hell is Gnolom and God dwells in everlasting burnings:

> **_Those who commit the unpardonable sin are doomed to Gnolom - to dwell in hell, worlds without end._** As they concoct scenes of bloodshed in this world, so they shall rise to that resurrection which is as the lake of fire and brimstone. Some shall rise to the everlasting burnings of God; for **God dwells in everlasting burnings,** and some shall rise to the damnation of their own filthiness, which is exquisite a torment as the lake of fire and brimstone (MD, p. 316).


## Alle Frauen sind Töchter Gottes:

> **All women are daughters of God** because of their pre-existent birth as female spirits (MD, p. 179).


## Millionen werden nach dem Tod eine Gelegenheit zur Errettung haben:

> **The millions who pass to the spirit world without receiving an opportunity during mortality to hear the truths of salvation will receive their chance subsequent to what men call death** (MD, p. 673).


## Das Blut Jesu sühnt nicht für die Sünde des Mordes:

> But under certain circumstances **there are some serious sins for which the cleansing of Christ does not operate**, and the law of God is that **men must then have their own blood shed to atone for their sins. Murder, for instance, is one of these sins** (MD, p. 92).


## Luzifer versuchte, der Erlöser/Heiland der menschlichen Rasse zu sein:

> When the plans for creating and peopling the earth were under discussion in heaven, **Lucifer sought to destroy the free agency of man by obtaining power to force the human family to do his will, promising the Father that by such means he would redeem all mankind** so that not one of them should be lost. This proposition was rejected, while the original purpose of the Father - to use persuasive influences of wholesome precept and sacrificing example with the inhabitants of the earth, then to leave them free to choose for themselves - was agreed upon; and the one to be known as the Only Begotten Son was chosen as the chief instrument in carrying the purpose into effect (AOF, pp. 49,50).
> 
> We learn from the revealed word that Satan was once an angel of light, then known as Lucifer, a Son of the Morning; but his selfish ambition led him to aspire to the glory and power of the Father, to secure which **he made the pernicious proposition to redeem the human family** by compulsion; and, failing in this purpose, he headed an open rebellion against the Father and the Son, drawing a third of the hosts of heaven into his impious league (AOF, pp. 56,57).


## Um _ewiges Leben_ zu haben, muss man lernen, wie man _Götter_ sein kann:

> **Here, then, is [eternal life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternallife.html) - to know the only wise and true God; and _you have got to learn how to be gods yourselves,_** and to be kings and priests to God, the same as all gods have done before you, namely, by going from one small degree to another, and from a small capacity to a great one; from grace to grace, from exaltation to exaltation, until you attain to the resurrection of the dead, and are able to dwell in everlasting burnings, and to sit in glory, as do those who sit enthroned in everlasting power ... (MD, p. 321).


## Es gibt keine Errettung/kein Heil ausserhalb der HLT-Kirche:

> If it had not been for Joseph Smith and the restoration, there would be no salvation. **There is no salvation outside The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints** (MD, p. 670).


## Das wahre Evangelium kann man nur in der HLT-Kirche finden:

> **The true gospel of Jesus Christ** was restored to earth in the last days through the instrumentality of Joseph Smith. **It is found only in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints** (MD, p. 334).


## Der Präsident der HLT-Kirche hält die Schlüssel der Errettung/des Heils:

> **The President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints holds the keys of salvation for all men now living because he is the only one by whose authorization the sealing power of the priesthood can be used to seal men up to salvation** and exaltation in the kingdom of God. (D. & C. 132:7.) (MD, p. 411).


## Joseph Smith wurde gebraucht, um die Priesterschaft von Aarun und Melchisedek zu wiederherstellen:

> But the Lord in His mercy provided for the reestablishment of His Church in the last days, and for the last time; and prophets of olden time foresaw this era of renewed enlightenment, and sang in joyous tones of its coming. **This restoration was effected by the Lord through the Prophet Joseph Smith, who, together with Oliver Cowdery, in 1829, received the Aaronic Priesthood under the hands of [John the Baptist](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john_the_baptist.htm); and later the Melchizedek Priesthood under the hands of the former-day apostles, Peter, James, and John** (AOF, p.185).


## Das Buch Mormon war versteckt, anschliessend Joseph Smith abgegeben:

> **The final struggles between Nephites and Lamanites were waged in the vicinity of the Hill Cumorah, in what is now the State of New York, resulting in the destruction of the Nephites as a nation, about 400 A. D. The last Nephite representative was Moroni, who, wandering for safety from place to place, daily expecting death from the victorious Lamanites, wrote the concluding parts of the [Book of Mormon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon-1.html), and hid the record in Cumorah. It was this same Moroni who, as a resurrected being, gave the records into the hands of Joseph Smith in the present dispensation** (AOF, pp. 235,236).


## Die Amerikanischen Indianer waren Juden nach ihrer Nationalität:

> **Daher waren Indianer Jüdisch nach ihrer Nationalität** (MD, S. 33).


## Adam existierte vor seiner Schöpfung in Eden. He ist auch Michael der Erzengel und hält die Schlüssel der Errettung von aller Welt:

> He [Adam] sat in the council of the gods in the planning of the creation of this earth, and then, under Christ, **participated in the creative enterprise .... Adam (with the exalted title of Michael the Archangel) led the hosts of the righteous in the war in heaven. (Rev. 12:7-9.) ... holds the keys of salvation over all the earth** (MD, pp. 16,17).
> 
> **Ein _Erzengel_ ist ein führender Engel. Michael (Adam) ist der Einzige, so designated in the scriptures proper** (MD, p. 51).


## Adam wird genannt _Ancient of Days_ and all who have held keys of authority will account to him:

> **Adam is known as the _Ancient of Days_ **(MD, p. 34).
> 
> At this council, **all who have held keys of authority will give an account of their stewardship to Adam** (MD, p. 21).


## Der Garden Eden war in Missouri:

> The early brethren of this dispensation taught that **the Garden of Eden was located in what is known to us as the land of Zion, an area for which Jackson County, Missouri, is the center place** (MD, p. 20).


## Ehebrecher werden ewiges Feuer erleiden, anschliessend sollen sie ins telestial Königreich kommen:

> **Adulterers shall be cast down to hell to suffer the vengeance of eternal fire; and their eventual destiny - after suffering the torments of the damned until the second resurrection - shall be that of the telestial kingdom** (MD, pp. 23,24).


## Die wichtigsten Dinge, die ein HLT-Mitglied in seinem Leben tun kann, zentriert um die Ehe:

> _The most important things that any member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints ever does in this world are: **1\. To marry the right person, in the right place, by the right authority; and 2\. To keep the covenant made in connection with this holy and perfect order of matrimony - thus assuring the obedient persons of an inheritance of exaltation in the celestial kingdom**_(MD, p. 118).


## Der Mensch kann Gott werden:

> **Endowed with agency and subject to eternal laws, man began his progression and advancement in pre-existence, his ultimate goal being to attain a state of glory, honor, and exaltation like the Father of spirits.** During his earth life he gains a mortal body, receives experience in earthly things, and prepares for a future eternity after the resurrection when he will continue to gain knowledge and intelligence. (D. & C. 130:18-19.) This gradually unfolding course of advancement and experience - a course that began in a past eternity and will continue in ages future - is frequently referred to as a course of _eternal progression_ .... In the full sense, eternal progression is enjoyed only by those who receive exaltation. Exalted persons gain the fulness of the Father; they have all power, all knowledge, and all wisdom; they gain a fulness of truth, **becoming one with the Father.** (MD, pp. 238, 239).

> **That exaltation which the saints of all ages have so devoutly sought is _godhood_ itself. Godhood** is to have the character, possess the attributes, and enjoy the perfections **which the Father has. It is to do what he does, have the powers resident in him, and live as he lives, having eternal increase** (MD, p. 321).


## Nur der Teufel, seine Engel und abtrünnige/abgefallene Mormonen (Söhne des Verderbens) werden auf ewig in die Hölle kommen:

> They were denied bodies, were cast out onto the earth, and thus came the devil and his angels - a great host of _sons of perdition._ **Those in this life who gain a perfect knowledge of the divinity of the gospel cause, a knowledge that comes only by revelation from the Holy Ghost, and who then link themselves with Lucifer and come out in open rebellion, also become sons of perdition.** Their destiny, following their resurrection, is to be cast out with the devil and his angels, to inherit the same kingdom in a state where "their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched" . . . . Joseph Smith said: "All sins shall be forgiven, except the sin against the Holy Ghost; for **Jesus will save all except the sons of perdition** (MD, p. 746).

> After their resurrection, the great majority of **those who have suffered in hell** will pass into the telestial kingdom; **the balance, cursed as sons of perdition, will be consigned to partake of endless wo with the devil and his angels** (MD, p. 350).

> **Thus, for those who are heirs of some salvation, which includes all except the sons of perdition (D. & C. 76:44), hell has an end** (MD, p. 351).


## <font color="purple">Die Tatsächliche Wahrheit Bezüglich Der Errettung</font>

According to the one and only proven source of God's word (the **[Holy Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)**), salvation is only found in the virgin born Son of God, who shed his **[holy blood](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesusblood.html)** for every sin. When a person turns from their own sins and extends a trusting-submitting faith in the Lord Jesus for salvation he gets instantly forgiven and becomes a child of God (Acts 20:21; 3:19; 1 Jn. 5:12,13). A faith in Jesus that brings one into the kingdom of God will always produce good fruit and holy living (Mt. 7:19; Heb. 12:14; James 2:14-17). Any person can experience all of this without any church to mediate for them, especially the LDS Church, which is filled with so many doctrinal myths. Unfortunately, however, such is not of the LDS beliefs! After initial salvation, **[one must endure to the end to enter God's kingdom](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** (Mt. 10:22) and be faithful to Christ not to be hurt by the second death (Rev. 2:10,11). We must hold firm to the end to share in Christ (Heb. 3:14). In the Kingdom, the saints will never reach Godhood, but will always be a son (Rev. 21:7).

Not only isn't the LDS Church needed for salvation, as they claim for themselves, but they are spreading many deadly untruths about **[Almighty God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.html)**, the Lord Jesus, the **[devil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html)**, those who go to **[Hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html)**, how to be saved, life beyond the grave, **[God's word](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wordgod.html)**, etc. Also, it is easy for one to claim to be a prophet, like Joseph Smith has, but it is another thing to prove it. Smith has made numerous false prophecies, which is impossible for God's true prophets to make (Dt. 18:21,22), and is, therefore, a _deceiver_ who has misled many, just like the kind the Lord Jesus warned would come (Mt. 24:11).

**Dear reader, please do not be deceived by the sincerity of, or the friendly way, the Mormon people might treat you. The LDS beliefs are not God's truth.** Remember, what you believe and do now in this lifetime will affect you throughout all eternity. Therefore, learn the message of the Bible and commit yourself to the one, true, living God, who has power to have you thrown into Hell forever.
