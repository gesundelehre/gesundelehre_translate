## Mormons Believe ALL Non-Mormon Creeds Are An Abomination

**Sometimes when a Christian mentions the false prophecies of Joseph Smith, Jr. or that the [Book of Mormon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon-1.html) contradicts the Holy Scriptures (Bible) the Mormon missionaries will say something to the effect as to, _why are you picking on us._ The truth is: Christianity has been under attack by their false prophets and false doctrines for over 150 years.**

One of their false teachings from their founder and false prophet, **[Joseph Smith, Jr.](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormons.html)** speaks volumes about how Mormons view **[Christian beliefs](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-beliefs.html)** and how they are vastly different. The following is from their _Pearl of Great Price_:

My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know **which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join.** No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, **which of all the sects was right—and which I should join**. I was answered that **I must join none of them, for they were all wrong**; and the Personage who addressed me said that **all their creeds were an abomination in his sight .... He again forbade me to join with any of them** (Joseph Smith - History 1:18-20).

It should be apparent from the above that: (1) **[Mormonism is totally unlike all the other religions and creeds](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ldsbeliefs.htm)** and (2) **Teaches all non-Mormon creeds are an _abomination_ in God’s sight, which would have to include the sacrificial and redemptive death of the Lord Jesus on the cross and his resurrection from the grave on the third day.**

For a Christian to _expose_ the strange teachings of Mormonism, or even more importantly, to refute them with the Bible, is not being anything but _loving and obedient to God_. **The LDS (Mormon) message is _not_ the same as the Bible’s and, therefore, is not from God.** Sincere people have been deceived by Mormonism and desperately need to know the truth of God before it is too late. Please see our other teachings on **_[Mormonism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormon.html)_**. GOD BLESS YOU.
