# Die Trinität

## Einführung

### If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

![So, If I'm supposed to be God, then am I am sacrficing myself to myself? Or did i just blow your mind!?](../files/pictures/dividingword_intro_1.jpg)

If word has not gotten around yet that I have gone apostate and have denied the Faith, I want to personally give you my testimony concerning the Trinity Doctrine. I realize that even THINKING of indulging such a thought to see if it is true or not is a NO NO among mainstream Christianity. Anyone knows that to touch this subject is like trying to handle a hot potato and risks being ostracize by his peers. Es braucht nicht unbedingt klare Worte, damit man erkennt, dass sich nun ein Riss in der Beziehung befindet.

We know that when we come to reveal opposing views of doctrines that have been taught for hundreds of years without question and accepted as the norm, we usually end up with knee-jerk reactions by those who have held to these doctrines they have been taught. The end result is that the person opposing a doctrine taught for so long ends up at the end of a stick, whipped with name calling, loses relationships, and even going so far as to be told they are not Christians but rather a child of the devil and not really saved.

One of the dogmas my eyes were opened to was the false teaching of Original Sin and a lot of others followed such as the false teaching of Once Saved, Always Saved, Substitution, Pre-Trib Rapture, etc.. Now it seems the journey in my life is to investigate this doctrine of the Trinity, a doctrine by main stream Christianity that we dare not question.

I am not saying I have all the answers, but it does leave room for a lot of questions - questions that have bugged me for a long time, but since I have been programed that this topic is not up for discussion, I have always laid the issue aside as a no big deal. But lately, I have been giving it some serious thought.

Einige harte Fragen, die wir uns selbst stellen müssen, wenn wir an der Lehre der Trinität festhalten:

1. Where in the Bible does it state that if one does not believe in the Trinity, they are not saved?

2. Wo in der Bibel heisst es Jesus ist völlig Mensch genauso wie VÖLLIG GOTT?

3.  Wo in der Schrift heisst es "Gott der Sohn?"

4. Da Jesus am Kreuz starb, WANN STARB GOTT? Kann Gott sterben? Not according to Scripture. Wenn Jesus völlig Gott und gleichzeitig völlig Mensch gewesen wäre, so bliebe nur die Schlussfolgerung, dass 1/3 von Gott starb. Es führt kein Weg darum herum.

5. If Jesus was fully God, then Jesus had an advantage over us and could not sin because He is God. How does this help me to understand Jesus was tempted in all points as we are when God cannot be tempted?

6. If Jesus is God and and the Holy Spirit is God, why is speaking against Jesus (God) a sin that can be forgiven, but speaking against the Holy Spirit (God) is a sin that can never be forgiven? So in essence, we must really say, If we blaspheme God it is a forgivable sin, but if we blaspheme God is not forgivable.

7. If the Holy Spirit is God and supposedly a person, then why is the Holy Spirit not worshiped? Warum wird 1/3 von Gott aus dieser Gleichung ausgelassen, wenn der heilige Geist Gott ist?

Ich wurde katholisch erzogen trat sogar einmal dem Kloster bei, so when it comes to the doctrine of the Trinity, this is all I have ever known, and in the Protestant world as well - that there are three persons in One God.

Lies Röm. 8,15
Die Bibel sagt uns, dass jene die wiedergeboren sind, Gott als ihren Vater haben.

- If God is a trinity of co-equal persons, then why does only one person become our Father when all three are in relationship with us?

- If "God the Son" and "God the Holy Spirit" our not our Father as well, then what are they in relation to us when we receive the Spirit of adoption?

- Wenn eine Person unser Vater wird, sollten die andern zwei dann nicht auch unser Vater sein, da sie co-equally unser Gott sind?

Siehe Markus 13,32. Absolut niemand weiss von der Rückkehr Christi ausser dem Vater. It is understandable that Christ would not know, but there is a person missing. What is missing is the co-equal person of the trinity - the Holy Spirit.

- Was wäre der Grund, weshalb ihn Jesus auslässt?

- Is not the Holy Spirit supposed to be equal in knowledge with the Father since we are taught God is omniscient?

- If the Spirit is a distinct co-equal person, why is he not mentioned as knowing the time of Christ's return?

Lies 1 Tim. 5:21. Notice here that Paul charged Timothy before (in the presence of) God, and the Lord Jesus Christ, and the elect angels. "Gott" wie im Vater, was offensichtlich ist. What did Paul fail to mention? Abermals, es ist der heilige Geist. Der heilige Geist wird aus der Gleichung ausgelassen.

Wenn der heilige Geist tatsächlich eine verschiedene Person in der Trinität ist, warum wird er dann nicht auch erwähnt als zusammen mit dem Rest der Himmlischen Heerscharen mit Paulus und Timotheus gegenwärtig zu sein? Is he not important as the others?

Lies Johannes 17,3. Notice Jesus states that to receive eternal life, we only have to know the Father and the Son. If we believe in the trinity, should we not have a problem because Jesus seems to have forgotten to mention the third co-equal person, the Holy Spirit?

Since the doctrine of the trinity believes that the Spirit is a distinct person, then isn't eternal life by knowing the Holy Spirit as well? Warum ist er fehlend/abwesend von der Schrift?

When it comes to the Trinity, it is interesting to see people try to explain what they say is unexplainable and a mystery. Wenn sie es nicht erklären können, wie kann dann die Person die sie lehren, fähig sein, es zu verstehen? Everybody ends up trying to explain something they don't understand and we end up with a lot of people who try to explain what they say is unexplainable! Ich war da! [im Sinn von "ich hab das selbst erlebt!"]

Es gibt noch mehr!

"Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am tempted by God"; for God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does He Himself tempt anyone."

Es ist deutlich, dass Gott nicht versucht werden kann. Es stünde nicht offen zur Debatte. Now, if God cannot be tempted, how do we explain to others that Jesus is God when Scripture clearly tells us God cannot be tempted and Jesus was tempted?

We end up doing a lot of explaining to get past the clear passages of Scripture concerning this topic.

Ich werde dies sagen, und ich habe es bisher nie einer anderen Person ausser kürzlich eingestanden. When I would sometimes pray, I would always have in the back of my mind, "Am I praying to Jesus, am I praying to God, am I praying to the Holy Spirit, am I praying to all three, and why pray in Jesus' name if all three are God?

Where it concerns my journey to begin questioning the Trinity, I cannot say that it was any one thing that led me to investigate this issue, but rather it was a culmination of things that I have studied that has brought me to this point. Ich sah auch ein Ausschnitt, der wirklich meine Aufmerksamkeit bekam. Als Jesus zu Petrus sagte, "Wer sagen die Menschen, dass ich sei? War Petrus' Antwort die Folgende?

> _"Thou are the Logos, existing in the Father as His rationality and then, by an act of His will, being generated, in consideration of the various functions by which God is related to his creation, but only on the fact that Scripture speaks of a Father, and a Son, and a Holy Spirit, each member of the Trinity being coequal with every other member, and each acting inseparably with and interpenetrating every other member, with only an economic subordination within God, but causing no division which would make the substance no longer simple."_

> _Und Jesus antwortete und sprach "Was?"_

Die einfache Antwort von Petrus war,

> _Thou art Christ, **THE SON** of the living God._

Und wie antwortete Jesus?

> _Jesus answered and said to him, You are blessed, Simon, son of Jonah, **for flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but My Father in Heaven.** Mat 16:17_

Many have accused me of defecting from the faith and someone just recently reminded me that not long ago I was defending the Trinity doctrine. Yes, it is true that I did defend the Trinity doctrine. I also at one time defended the OSAS doctrine, the Pre-trib doctrine, Original sin doctrine, etc.. The same person that accuses me, does he not remember when he defended certain doctrines that were not biblical and made corrections that was necessary?

Wenn uns Gott der Vater Wahrheit offenbart, so können wir uns nicht davon abwenden. Many are content with staying in the "safe zone" rather than search the Scriptures. God never chastises anyone for studying His word. As another brother well stated, "Our past statements should not influence our acceptance of current light or truth." So I'm sure none of us, when we have been given further light, would want our past beliefs held against us. Es ist nicht einfach, kleine Brötchen zu backen, wenn wir einsehen, dass wir im Irrtum waren und es berichtigen müssen.

Eine der Dinge, die ich bemerkt habe, ist dass nicht eine der obigen Fragen adressiert wird.

Ich mag dies anfügen. Jakobus sagt,

> _... Du glaubst, dass GOTT EINER IST. Du tust wohl. Auch die Dämonen glauben - und schaudern._

This might sound offensive, but it's a shame that the demons know who Jesus is more than us Christians.

There is not one single instance of the many recorded examples of Jesus' casting out of demons where the demons ever even hinted that he is God. Nicht einen. Sie sprachen Jesus an als:

Der Heilige Gottes  
Der Sohn Gottes  
Der Sohn Gottes des Höchsten [engl.The Son of the most high God; verdolmetscht Der Sohn des Allerhöchsten Gottes]  
Der Messias (Christus; verdolmetscht: der Gesalbte)  
Der Sohn von Gott dem Allerhöchsten

Es ist wahr, wir beziehen unsere Wahrheit nicht von Dämonen, aber was sie sagten ist Wahrheit. Like James says, "You believe that GOD IS ONE you do well; the demons also believe, and shudder."

Sogar Dämonen glauben, dass Gott einer ist.

Calling Jesus "Messiah," "Lord Messiah," "the Lord Jesus," "the Lord Jesus Christ," or "our Lord Jesus Christ" was a common practice among the early believers.

However, calling Jesus "the Lord God," "the Lord our God," or "the Almighty" are Biblical titles exclusively for the Father OF Jesus and were never practiced by the early believers in reference to Jesus.

Jesus was never referred to as _"God the Son."_

When I came upon knowing the teaching of Original sin was false, I knew in my spirit it was correct. When I tried to share this with my friends, they shunned me and called me all kinds of names. I was not yet well equipped to answer all their objections and it took me about two years of study this issue because of the centuries of what has been taught and taken for granted. It is the same with this teaching. As I said above, I don't have all the answers, and doubt if I ever will, but I trust the Holy Spirit will guide me. Ich werde Dinge teilen, während ich in dieser Untersuchung/Studie vorankomme. What I don't need is for someone to spam me or try and convince me the Trinity is Biblical since I have already been there and know all about the teaching of this doctrine. Remember, I once defended it.

But what I also want to say is this - that if you become awakened from your drugged state of this awful doctrine, it will cost you. You are coming against a monster that is accepted by mainstream Christianity all over the world that has accepted a teaching that came about 300 to 400 years AFTER Christ. You will find your questions are totally ignored, but yet you are expected to answer theirs.

Hundreds of years ago believers suffered death because they held to the words and teachings of Christ and the apostles. John Calvin had Michael Servetus killed (among others) because Servetus did not subscribed to the teaching of the Trinity. Instead of killing today, the best they can do now is attack your character, say all kinds of evil against you; anything to try and silence you. Wie mit irgendeiner von Gottes Wahrheiten, brennt sie innerhalb von Herzen und kann nicht ruhig bleiben.


## Bedenke

I am going to start you off with something to keep in mind, and that is to remember there is a difference between Jesus (Yeshua) and God (Yahweh).

![PICTURE](../files/pictures/dividingword_intro_2.jpg)

Hör auf Petrus in seiner Antwort auf Jesus' Frage:

> _"He [Jesus] said to them, But who do you say I am? And Simon Peter answered and said, **You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.** Jesus answered and said to him, You are blessed, Simon, son of Jonah, for flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but My Father in Heaven."_

As with Peter, this is a revelation recently given to me as well from God the Father concerning His Son. The only way I can describe it is that the light bulb did not give off any light until I saw the light. As long as I was defending and believing in the Trinity doctrine, that revelation was hidden from me. Gott der Vater wird nicht reden bis wir bereit sind, zu hören. As I said before, this is new for me and I am not yet well equipped to answer all the objections. All I can do is study and lean on the holy Spirit to guide me into all truth as promised he will do. God will also give us teachers to help guide us for he gives us teachers (Eph. 4:11) to help us, but as with any teacher, we must test it against the word of God. A teacher can teach, but God will give the revelation within your spirit when truth is taught.

Remember, Peter said to Jesus (Yeshua) "**You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,"** not God (Yahweh). This is the simple truth and you can believe it's true, but until it's **revealed** to you, then you will know the difference! Jesus said, "You are blessed, Simon, son of Jonah,<u>**for flesh and blood did not reveal it to you, but My Father in Heaven.**</u>

Yes, it's understandable that probably a whole number of verses are flying through your mind at the moment, just as it did mine, because most of the readers, as I, have been taught nothing but the Trinity doctrine. Aber bitte lies Petrus' Antwort nochmals oben. Jesus (Yeshua) is called the **"...the Christ, the Son of the living God."**


## Monotheistische Tradition

> **"If the foundations are destroyed, what can the righteous do? (Ps. 11:3)**

The saints of the Old Covenant were <u>strictly monotheistic</u>. The monotheistic tradition continued and Jesus did not change it.

Jesus, **our Apostle,** had only one creed about God our Father and I would rather appeal to his creed than the Athanasian creed which says in a nutshell,

> _"Whoever wants to be saved, before all things it is necessary that he hold the catholic [universal] faith; which faith unless everyone keeps it whole and undefiled, without doubt he will perish everlastingly. And the catholic faith is this: that we worship one God in Trinity, and Trinity in Unity; neither confounding the persons nor dividing the substance The Father eternal, the Son eternal and the Holy Spirit eternal, and they are not three eternals but one eternal So likewise the Father is almighty, the Son almighty, and the Holy Spirit almighty. Und dennoch sind sie nicht drei Allmächtige, sondern ein Allmächtiger. Also ist der Vater Gott, der Sohn ist Gott und der Heilige Geist ist Gott. And yet they are not three Gods, but one God. So likewise the Father is Lord, the Son Lord and the Holy Spirit Lord; and yet they are not three Lords but one Lord. For just as we are compelled by the Christian verity to acknowledge every Person by himself to be God and Lord, so we are forbidden by the catholic religion to say there are three Gods or three Lords .And in this Trinity none is before or after another; none is greater or less than another. But the whole three persons are coeternal and coequal. So that in all things, as aforesaid, the Unity in Trinity and the Trinity in Unity is to be worshipped. He who wants to be saved must thus think of the Trinity."_

I cannot see Jesus subscribing to this creed or the Nicene creed, but only that creed which has been taught throughout Scripture. He, too, would come under the cruel anathemas of this "Christian" creed, just as others.

Jesus affirmed the creed of Israel, that there is only **one God**. The Old Testament is strictly monotheistic. Gott ist ein einzelnes persönliches Wesen.

> _**"Höre, Israel! Der Herr, unser Gott, ist EIN Herr/Gott,"**_

Sogar Paulus, ein Jude aller Juden, sagte,

> _There is one God and one mediator between God and men, the man Messiah Jesus (1.Tim. 2:5)_

Aber das ist nicht genug für das Christentum.

Are we obeying Jesus' commandments? Jesus has a right to tell us who God is and we should not ignore Jesus' understanding of monotheism. Jesus never demonstrated a new creed of defining who God is. We must appeal to the creed of Jesus (Yeshua), concerning the **"first commandment,"**

> _Höre, Israel! Der HERR, unser Gott, ist EIN HERR. (Markus 12,29; Jantzen-NT)_

Johannes 17,3 hält Jesu eigenen strikten Monotheismus fest. Er deklarierte, dass

> _Du, Vater, bist der einzige, der wahrhaftig Gott ist._

Jesus lehrte nie, dass er Gott sei. Werden wir dem glauben, was Jesus sagte? Instead of believing what Jesus taught so we can all speak the same thing (1 Cor. 1:10), it has led to years of confusion, conflict, and a war on words because we have read Scriptures through the filter of the Trinity teaching that was not taught at the time of Christ, but came 300-400 years later.

We must go back to **Monotheistic Tradition** as taught throughout Scripture. I don't know about  you, but I would rather put my faith in the words of God as my foundation rather than on Statements of Faith based on creeds formed centuries later.

Jesus (Yeshua) ist nicht Gott (Yahweh). Höre GANZ sorgfältig auf das was Jesus sagt,

> _"And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom You have sent."_

Dies ist der SOHN GOTTES, zu SEINEM VATER betend. Dies sind die Worte von Jesus selbst. Dare we not agree with him? Man has to come up with a lot of philosophical explanations, pictures, and have us do a lot of mindless gymnastics as they try to explain the Trinity in order for us to have some kind of understanding about it. And if we don't understand it, just accept it "by faith," so we are told. Aber Gott bewahre/Wehe, wenn du es ablehnst!

Bisher sind die Worte von Petrus und Jesus ziemlich einfach. Jesus (Yeshua) did not do away with the **Monotheistic doctrine** and change it into a  **Trinitarian doctrine.**

Lasst und Paulus' Warnung beachten:

> _If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ AND the teaching that accords with godliness, he has an over-high opinion of himself; being without knowledge, having only an unhealthy love of questionings and wars of words, from which come envy, fighting, cruel words, evil thoughts. (1 Tim. 6:3)_

I encourage that we search the Scriptures for ourselves rather than run to just about every commentary that interprets Scripture through the filter of the Trinity doctrine. As someone who aptly stated:

> _"Es ist besser, durch Wahrheit getrennt zu sein, als im Irrtum vereint zu sein. It is better to speak the truth that hurts, and then heals, than falsehood that comforts, then kills. Es ist nicht Liebe, und es ist nicht Freundschaft, wenn versagen, den ganzen Ratschluss Gottes bekannt zu machen. It is better to be hated for telling the truth than to be loved for telling a lie. It is impossible to find anyone in the Bible who was a power for God who did not have enemies and was not hated. It's better to stand alone with the truth than to be wrong with a multitude. It is better ultimately to succeed with truth than to temporarily succeed with a lie."_

Vertrau auf den Heiligen Geist, der uns in alle Wahrheit führen wird.

> _"But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you." (John 14:26)_
