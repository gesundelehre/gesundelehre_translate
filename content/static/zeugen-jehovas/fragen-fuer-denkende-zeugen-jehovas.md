31\. While it is certainly true that we "**[must endure to the end to be saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**," "hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first" and remain "faithful" to the point of death to avoid being thrown into the lake of fire (Mt. 10:22; Heb. 3:14; Rev. 2:10,11), we can still know we are saved presently like they did in first century Christianity, if we are currently putting into practice the Word of God (Lk. 8:21). _____TRUE _____FALSE.

33\. Have you gone to Jesus in prayer for eternal life, as John 5:40 recommends? _____YES _____NO.

35\. In Acts 10:34-43, we read the Apostles Peter’s sermon that brought instant salvation to people who "received the word of God" (Acts 11:1). How much "accurate knowledge" did Cornelius and others have to take in to become Christians? _____MUCH _____NOT VERY MUCH.

36\. Did they have to submit to a 6 month book study, then join an organization before they were "saved" (Acts 11:14)? _____YES _____NO.

39\. When Paul and Silas were asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" (Acts 16:30), why didn’t they inform the ignorant, heathen jailer that he would have to submit to an extended study and join their organization before he could ever have the hope (not certainty) of present tense salvation? _____THEY DID ANSWER THAT WAY _____ BECAUSE SALVATION COMES INSTANTLY WHEN WE EXTEND A TRUSTING-SUBMITTING FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST.

40\. Did Paul and Silas say that he’d have to "believe on" the Father or the Son to be saved (Acts 16:31)? _____THE FATHER _____THE SON.
