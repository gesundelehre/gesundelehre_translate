## The Little Observed _Information About Jehovah's Witnesses_


### (Jehovah's Witness Doctrines Are NOT Original)


■1\. What the Jehovah’s Witnesses (JW) are teaching **others is NOT _original_ with them. They did NOT get that by reading the Bible for themselves!** _They were taught_ those twisted and deadly concepts from their Governing Body (the Watch Tower Society), which is a Bible-defined _false prophet._ **(Often the Jehovah's Witnesses think they discovered those so-called _truths_ by their own _research_ and Bible study, but somehow seem to forget their own intense indoctrination through _Watch Tower literature_ and _Kingdom Hall_ visits.**  PRIDE then helps to keep them spiritually blinded to God’s truths in the Bible.)

### Charles Taze Russell Got His Doctrine From Arius



**■2. The founder of that group ([Charles Taze Russell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles_russell.html)**) did _NOT_ get his weird doctrines from reading the Bible!  Russell got those doctrines from others such as _Arius of Alexandria_, a fourth century _heretic_**. (Arius was an outspoken enemy of the [**deity of Christ**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/deity-of-Christ.html), like Russell and all Jehovah's Witnesses.) Russell revived his doctrines and arguments and presented them as his own.



### Early Jehovah Witness Doctrine Stated That 1874 Was The _Exact Date_ Of The Lord's Return

 [![jehovahs witnesses](../files/pictures/facts-on-jehovahs-witnesses.png "jehovahs witnesses")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html)

**■ 3\. Some of what Russell taught regarding various subjects important to the JW is now being denied and/or avoided because they are clear and definite contradictions to their own current teachings. Those teachings by Russell reveal him as a _false prophet_ and unable to _understand the Scriptures!_**  For example, Russell wrote:

> The next chapter will present **Bible evidence that **1874 A.D. was the exact date of the beginning of the “Times of Restitution,” and hence of **our Lord’s return. (_Study In The Scriptures_, Vol. 2, (Watch Tower Bible And Tract Society),1908 ed., p. 170.)

NOTE: The Jehovah's Witnesses today are teaching that **1914** was the _Lord’s return_, thereby denying the “light” (really _darkness_ taught as _light_) from Russell. **Also, note that Russell stated 1874 was derived from _Bible evidence._** Obviously, Russell’s **_Bible evidence_** was non-existent since they now teach 1914 instead of 1874\. Russell was therefore a _deceiver,_ which is what the Lord said _false prophets_ are (Mt. 24:11).

**Many sincere people back then were clearly _deceived_ by Russell’s _Bible evidence_ and still are today in other areas!** That is the _deceiver_ and man who started the [**Jehovah’s Witnesses**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html). Here are more _empty words_ and false teachings from him:

> ... likewise the forty years of **the Gospel age harvest will end October, 1914, and that likewise the overthrow of “Christendom,” so-called, must be expected to immediately follow**.  “In one hour” judgment shall come upon her.—Rev. 18:10, 17, 19\. (ibid., p. 245)

**Russell was a deluded, yet convincing _false teacher_**.  It should be apparent he was _darkness_, not “light,” not a “[**righteous**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/righteous.html) man,” but a **_spokesman for the_ [_devil_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html)**_,_ who has stumbled millions over the years. Russell even went outside of the Bible to the _Great Pyramid_ for his weird and lethal doctrines:

> .... **the Great Pyramid of Egypt is one of God’s Witnesses**  (Isa. 19:19,20), whose wonderful message is a full and complete corroboration of God’s plan of the ages, together with its times and seasons. (ibid., p. 366)

**Isa. 19:19,20 has nothing to do with the _Great Pyramid._** Here is what that passage says:

> In that day there will be an altar to the LORD in the heart of Egypt, and a monument to the LORD at its border. It will be a sign and witness to the LORD Almighty in the land of Egypt. When they cry out to the LORD because of their oppressors, he will send them a savior and defender, and he will rescue them.

### Wrong About Their Preaching Of _Good News Of The Kingdom_

**■4. The Jehovah's Witnesses are constantly telling others about the _1,000 year reign of Christ of perfect peace on paradise earth._ WHY? They wrongly think that is _[preaching the good news of the kingdom](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/good-news-of-the-kingdom.html)_. In other words, they think that message is the “gospel.”**

**When the [Christian](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html) mentions that NEVER in  the book of Acts—not even one time—did any of the Apostles (Peter, Paul, etc.) or other disciples like Stephen, Philip, etc. ever mention the 1,000 year reign of Christ as they spread the _gospel,_ the Jehovah's Witnesses are _speechless_ and _exposed_. The Jehovah's Witnesses are spreading “another gospel,” which has no power to save anyone. That is a FACT and a death-blow to their chief, central message.**  That is also the _**rotten fruit_** from their own _Governing Body_ in Brooklyn, NY.

The real preaching of “the good news of the kingdom” is related to spreading the **[true plan of salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)**, which brings eternal life and which they also deny one can have now! The plan of salvation is shown in detail, in part and/or by inference **_dozens_** of times in the Book of Acts. It is concisely stated in Acts 20:21:

> **I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance  and have faith in our Lord Jesus.**

That is the message which sets the sin-slave free and brings [**eternal life**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternallife.html), because then and then only does a person “have the Son,” as mentioned in 1 John 5:12,13, etc.

The Jehovah's Witnesses are under the dangerous delusion that [**taking in (accurate) "knowledge"**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john173.html) as defined by the Watch Tower Society, is related to getting _eternal life!_ (Eternal life to them is simply _living forever on Paradise earth.  _**They know nothing about eternal life NOW, this side of the grave, through _[instant salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/instant_salvation.html)**.)

### Facts On Jehovah's Witnesses -- Their Evasion Tactics

**■5. Jehovah's Witnesses often deny what others _accurately_ say about them _so they don’t have to deal with it!_ They say something like, _We don’t believe that!_ Or _We don’t teach that!_ Or _I don’t see your point!_ That is, in part, how they were trained by their leaders in Brooklyn. That is part of their _war strategy._**  In other words, at times they are taught to **_lie and deceive!_**  Here is how they define **_a lie_** in their own literature:

> **Lying** generally involves saying something false to a person who is **entitled to know the truth** .... (_Aid To Bible Understanding,_ Watch Tower Bible And Tract Society, 1971, p. 1060.)

If you are an enemy of the JW false gospel you are **not _entitled to know the truth_** from them_, **if you make a point they can’t deal with._** We have seen this even when exact quotes and full documentation are supplied. Shocking, but true! Such Watch Tower **_robots_** are sealing their own **_damnation_** by closing their eyes to such evidence.

Some Jehovah's Witnesses even think _any evidence,_ even from a non-credible source, is sufficient backing for their point. Anything will do, as long as it aligns itself with what the Watch Tower literature says. Hence, many remain _blind followers of the blind._

**In conclusion: Many Jehovah's Witnesses were never saved, yet some were. They are all _lost_ now and refuse to come to JESUS for the _living water_ and salvation he holds out to all (John 4:10; 5:39,40; etc). They claim they “have the Son” yet they don’t claim to have the eternal life now which goes with having the Son (1 John 5:12). They also can’t LOOK TO and TRUST JESUS for their salvation, since they even have _another Jesus._ All that is what false prophets do to their victims and are _facts on Jehovah's Witnesses._ GOD BLESS YOU.**
