## KNOW This About The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_

**How can we KNOW for certain if the _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ of Jehovah's Witnesses is a _dangerous false prophet_ or not?** The Bible makes this answer easy and clear:

> "And IF thou say in thine heart, **HOW SHALL WE <u>KNOW</u>** the word which the LORD hath not spoken? When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shall not be afraid of him" (Deut. 18: 21, 22).

## [ALL Jehovah's Witnesses Should Know These Prophet Test Questions](#watchtower%20bible%20and%20tract%20society)

Notice: There are only two points to consider to "know" a false prophet:

[![jehovah's witnesses watchtower society](../files/pictures/jehovahs-witnesses-street-preaching.jpg "The Jehovah's Witnesses do NOT have the truth as they adamently claim to have.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/good-news-of-the-kingdom.html)

(1) Does he speak in the name of the LORD? (2) Did the thing predicted fail to come to pass?

**Point 1.** The Watchtower Bible and Tract Society's claim to be Jehovah's Prophet.

> "More accurately, was there any group on whom Jehovah would be willing to bestow the commission to speak as a 'prophet' in His name, as was done toward Ezekiel back there in 613 B.C.E.? (The Watchtower, 3-15-72, p. 189). "It is of importance to every individual on earth to identify the group that Jehovah has commissioned as his 'servant' or messenger.... For this reason forthcoming issues of The Watchtower will further discuss the identity and work of Jehovah's commissioned messenger as revealed in His vision to Ezekiel" (The Watchtower, 3-15-72, p. 190). "So, does Jehovah have a prophet to help them, to warn them of dangers and to declare things to come? These questions can be answered in the affirmative. Who is this prophet? ...This 'prophet' was not one man, but was a body of men and women. It was the small group of footstep followers of Jesus Christ, known at that time as International Bible Students. Today they are known as Jehovah's Christian witnesses... Of course, it is easy to say that this group acts as a 'prophet' of God. It is another thing to prove it. The only way that this can be done is to review the record. What does it show? (The Watchtower, 4-1-72, p. 197). "The scroll was doubtless delivered to Ezekiel by the hand of one of the cherubs in the vision. This would indicate that Jehovah's witnesses today make their declaration of the good news of the Kingdom under angelic direction and support. (Rev. 14:6, 7; Matt. 25:31, 32) And since no word or work of Jehovah can fail, for he is God Almighty, the nations will see the fulfillment of what these witnesses say as directed from heaven. Yes, the time must come shortly that the nations will have to know that really a 'prophet' of Jehovah was among them." (The Watchtower, 4-1-72, p. 200).

**Point 2.** Things the _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ said that "followed not."

> "Our Lord, the appointed King, is now present, since October 1874, A.D., according to the testimony of the prophets, to those who have ears to hear it." (The Battle of Armageddon, Studies in the Scriptures, Vol. 4, 1897 ed., p. 621)

> "...the 'battle of the great day of God Almighty' (Rev. 16:14), which will end in A.D. 1914 with the complete overthrow of earth's present rulership is already commenced." (The Time is at Hand, Studies in the Scriptures, Vol. 2, 1908 ed., p. 101)

> "Therefore we may confidently expect that 1925 will mark the return of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and the faithful prophets of old, particularly those named by the Apostle in Hebrews chapter eleven, to the condition of human perfection." (Millions Now Living Will Never Die, pp. 89,90)

> "The year 1925 is a date definitely and clearly marked in the Scriptures, even more clearly than that of 1914." (The Watchtower, 7-15-24, p. 211)

> "Our thought is, that 1925 is definitely settled by the Scriptures....As to Noah, the Christian now has much more upon which to base his faith than Noah had...." (The Watchtower, 4-1-23, p. 106) [Question: Was the Society wrong here about what is "definitely settled" by the Scriptures and what is not? Also, could they be wrong in other areas too, regarding what the Scriptures teach?]

> "It is to be expected that Satan will try to inject into the minds of the consecrated the thought that 1925 should see an end of the work.... Diligence now and to the end seems absolutely essential to victory." (The Watchtower, 9-1-25, p. 262)

> "Some anticipated that the work would end in 1925, but the Lord did not so state." (The Watchtower, 8-1-26, p. 232)

> "There was a measure of disappointment on the part of Jehovah's faithful ones on earth concerning the years 1914, 1918, and 1925, which disappointment lasted for a time....they also learned to quit fixing dates..." (Vindication, Book I, 1931 ed., pp. 338, 339)

> "Receiving the gift, the marching children clasped it to them, not a toy or plaything for idle pleasure, but the Lord's provided instrument for most effective work in the remaining months before Armageddon." (The Watchtower, 9-15-41, p. 288)

> "True, there have been those in times past who predicted an 'end to the world,' even announcing a specific date.... Yet, nothing happened. The 'end' did not come. They were guilty of false prophesying. Why? What was missing?.... Missing from such people were God's truths and the evidence that he was guiding and using them." (Awake, 10-8-68, p. 23)

> "The facts show that the angels of the Lord with him at his temple have been thus rendering service unto the remnant since 1919." (Vindication, p. 250)

> "Jehovah God has also provided his visible organization, his 'faithful and discreet slave,' made up of spirit-anointed ones, to help Christians in all nations to understand and apply properly the Bible in their lives. Unless we are in touch with this channel of communication that God is using, we will not progress along the road to life, no matter how much Bible reading we do." (The Watchtower, 12-1-81, p. 27)


## The Importance of Eve's Creation to 1975

The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ claims Armageddon will come within 6,000 years after the date of Eve's creation. In other words, if we add 6,000 years to the date of Eve's creation we will arrive at the date of the end of the world. **The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ declares there is but one problem, that is, no one knows the date of Eve's creation. However, this was NOT a problem BEFORE September 1975! The reason for this cover-up is obvious!**

This is what the _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ said about Eve's creation and 1975 AFTER Sept. 1975

> "Although the time of Adam's creation can be determined, the beginning of God's 'rest day' cannot. This is so because there was a time lapse of unspecified length between Adam's creation and the creation of Eve. Not until after the creation of Eve did God's 'rest day' begin. The start of that day being unknown, its end is likewise unknown." (The Watchtower, 1-1-76, p. 30)

> "Does this mean, then, that mankind has not reached 6,000 years into the 7,000-year period that God 'blessed and made sacred' as his great 'rest day'? Does it mean that Christ's millennial Kingdom rule, as the final 1,000 years of that 'rest day,' is to be reckoned from September 1975?-Gen. 1:27, 31; 2:2,3; Rev. 20:1-6\. No, it does not mean that. Why not? Well, the Bible record shows that God's creations on the 'day' just preceding that 7,000-year 'rest day' did not end with Adam's creation. It shows a time lapse between the creation of Adam and that of his wife, Eve. During that time, God had Adam name the animals. Whether that period amounted to weeks or months or years, we do not know. So we do not know exactly when Jehovah's great 'rest day' began, nor do we know exactly when it will end. The same applies to the beginning of Christ's millennial reign." (The Watchtower, 10-1-75, p. 579)


## Eve's Creation and 1975 BEFORE 1975

> "According to reliable Bible chronology, Adam and Eve were created in 4026 B.C.E." (Awake!, 10-8-68, p. 14)

> "Therefore, God's seventh day and the time man has been on earth apparently run parallel. To calculate where man is in the stream of time relative to God's seventh day of 7,000 years, we need to determine how long a time has elapsed from the year of Adam and Eve's creation in 4026 B.C.E. ....Thus, eight years remain to account for a full 6,000 years of the seventh day. Eight years from the autumn of 1967 would bring us to the autumn of 1975, fully 6,000 years into God's seventh day, his rest day." (The Watchtower, 5-1-68, p. 271)

> "At the age of 130 another son was born to her. Eve called his name Seth...." (Aid to Bible Understanding, 1971 ed., p. 538). If this information is compared to the chart in the lower right-hand corner of page 333 of the same volume, one will see, "From Adam's creation to the birth of Seth" was "130 years". Hence, both Adam and Eve were 130 years old when Seth was born, implying they were both created in the same year.

> "It would not be by mere chance or accident but would be according to the loving purpose of Jehovah God for the reign of Jesus Christ, the 'Lord of the sabbath,' to run parallel with the seventh millennium of man's existence." (Life Everlasting-In Freedom of the Sons of God, p. 30)

> "Even if one cannot see beyond 1975, is this any reason to be less active? The apostles could not see even this far; they knew nothing about 1975....If they had delayed or dillydallied and had been complacent with the idea the end was some thousands of years off they would never have finished running the race set before them." (The Watchtower, 8-15-68, p. 501)

> "Yes, the end of this system is so very near! Is that not reason to increase our activity?...Reports are heard of brothers selling their homes and property and planning to finish out the rest of their days in this old system in the pioneer service. Certainly this is a fine way to spend the short time remaining before the wicked world's end." (Kingdom Ministry, May 1974, p. 3) [Question: Was this sound counsel offered by the Society? What do you think happened to those who sold their homes and property and spent all the money, after it was apparent that they were misled about 1975? What would you have done if it was you?]

## The Deut. 18:21,22 Prophet Test and More

Read Deut. 18:20-22 for questions 1-6\. (This is also the PROPHET TEST, according to the following Watchtower publications: "Aid to Bible Understanding," 1971 ed., p. 1348; "Make Sure Of All Things Hold Fast To What Is Fine," 1965 ed., p. 394 and "Sermon Outlines," p. 8.) "But it may be asked, How are we to know whether one is a true or a false prophet? There are at least three ways by which we can positively decide: (1) If he is a true prophet, his message will come to pass exactly as prophesied. If he is a false prophet, his prophecy will fail to come to pass." (THE WATCHTOWER, 5-15-30, p. 154)

(1) According to Deut 18:20-22, what are the ONLY TWO CONSIDERATIONS GIVEN BY JEHOVAH to "KNOW" a true prophet from a false prophet? (v.22) (a) __________ (b) __________.

BEACHTE: Es gibt nur wahre Propheten und falsche Propheten. Die Bibel erwähnt keine dritte Klasse von Leuten, die "als Propheten sprechen"!

(2) Braucht es mehr als eine falsche Prophetie, um einen falschen Propheten zu identifizieren, falls er im Namen des HERRN spricht? ____JA ____NEIN.

(3) Does admitting to the false prophecy ("mistake" as called by some) have anything to do with clearing someone from being a false prophet? (v.22) ____JA ____NEIN. (The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ claims to admit their "mistakes" regarding dates. However, since they don't admit to their 1975 "mistake," are they telling the truth? ____JA ____NEIN.)

(4) Did Isaiah, Ezekiel, Jeremiah, Daniel, Amos, or any Bible prophet have to admit to any of their false prophecies? ____JA _____NEIN. Did they ever have to rely on Prov. 4:18, as The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ tries to? ____JA ____NEIN.

(5) Could Prov. 4:18 be a factor to consider to know a false prophet, since Jehovah gave only two considerations and this wasn't one of them? (v.22) ____JA ____NEIN, Proverbs 4:18 is not relevant here.

(6) Solltest DU dich vor dem fürchten, was ein falscher Prophet sagt? (v.22) ____JA ____NEIN.


## [Die Tödliche Verzerrung der Wachturmgesellschaft von Johannes 17,3](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john173.html)


## Lies Mt. 7,15-20 für die Fragen 7-14.

(7) Werden falsche Propheten wie Christen (Schafe) ausschauen? (v.15) ____JA ____NEIN.

(8) Sind falsche Propheten extrem gefährlich für jemandes geistliches Leben? (v.15) ____JA ____NEIN.

(9) Jesus sagte, dass falsche Propheten inwendig __________________ __________ sind (v.15).

(10) Können wir einen falschen Propheten "ERKENNEN" durch seine Früchte (Prophetie)? (v.16) ____JA ____NEIN. Ein Prophet produziert Prophetien wie ein Frucht Baum Früchte produziert.

(11) A good tree produces good fruit and an evil tree produces evil fruit, just like a true prophet produces true prophecies and a false prophet produces false __________ (v.17).

(12) Can a true prophet produce a single false prophecy? (v.18) ____JA ____NEIN. Please note: Jonah did not produce a false prophecy regarding the destruction of the Ninevites. Jeremiah wrote: "If at any time I announce that a nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down and destroyed, and if that nation I warned repents of its evil, then I will relent and not inflict on it the disaster I had planned" (18:7,8, NIV). This is EXACTLY what occurred with the Ninevites (Jonah 3:10). Furthermore, Micah 3:12 is just like Jonah's message to the Ninevites; yet Jer. 26:18,19 notes this pronouncement of judgment and comments upon it, in light of Jer. 18:7,8.

(13) Did Jesus agree with Deut. 18:21,22 when he said that we will "KNOW" a false prophet tree by his worthless fruit (false prophecies)? (v.20) ____JA ____NEIN. NOTICE: The "fruit of the spirit" listed in Gal. 5:22,23 is not the "fruit" of the false prophet spoken of in Matt. 7:15-20!

(14) Did Jesus say we should consider Prov. 4:18 as a factor to "KNOW" if someone is a false prophet or not? (v v.15-20) ____JA ____NEIN.

(15) From 2 Chronicles chapter 18, does the evidence identify Zedekiah as a true prophet? (Notice v. 10) ____JA ____NEIN. Does the evidence identify Micaiah as a true prophet? (Notice v. 27) ____JA ____NEIN. Furthermore, in Jeremiah chapter 28, does the evidence identify Hananiah as a true prophet? ____JA ____NEIN. [Please notice how Hananiah, in verses 2 through 4, contradicted Jeremiah's prediction in Jer. 25:11\. Be sure to ponder Jer. 28:9 and 28:15.] Does Jer. 28:9 show a similarity between Hananiah and the _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_'s many predictions about 1,000 years of peace coming after Armageddon, which was supposed to occur in 1914, in 1925, then in 1941, and then in 1975? ____JA ____NEIN.

(16) Considering Prov. 4:18, did the "light" for date-setting get any brighter from 1874 to 1975 for The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_? ____JA ____NEIN ____ Stayed the same.

(17) Zurück zu Jona, war er wütend, da die Niniveiten von ihren Sünden Busse taten und zu seinem Missfallen/Verdruss, zerstörte sie Jehova nicht? (Jona 3,10-4:3). ____JA ____NEIN.

(18) Sind falsche Propheten ein Zeichen der letzten Tage, in denen wir momentan leben? (Mt. 24,11) ____JA ____NEIN.

(19) Werden "VIELE" durch falsche Propheten verführt werden? (Mt. 24,11) ____JA ____NEIN.

(20) Werden falsche Propheten (und falsche Christen) solch überzeugende Beweise darbieten, dass wenn es möglich wäre, sogar die Auserwählten verführt würden? (Mt. 24,24) ____JA ____NEIN.

(21) Werden diejenigen, die durch einen falschen Propheten getäuscht wurden, obwohl aufrichtig, ewige Bestrafung bekommen gleich wie der falsche Prophet? (Hes. 14,10) ____JA ____NEIN.

(22) Beinhaltet das, dass alle falschen Propheten exzellente Täuscher sind? (Mt. 24,11,24) ____JA ____NEIN.

(23) Sagt die Bibel jemals etwas Gutes über falsche Propheten? ____JA ____NEIN.

(24) Sollten wir einem falschen Propheten trauen, die Bibel für uns zu interpretieren? ____JA ____NEIN.

(25) For my own future sake, I will personally check these cited _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ quotes which show false prophecies. _____TRUE _____FALSE.

(26) According to the aforementioned Armageddon prophecies, The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ is, as they claim, a prophet of Jehovah with the ability to "declare things to come" (THE WATCHTOWER, 3-15-72, pp. 189,190 and THE WATCHTOWER, 4-1-72, pp. 197-200). ____TRUE ____FALSE.

(27) The evidence cited in this study reveals the true identity of The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_, according to Deut. 18:21,22, to be: ____ TRUE PROPHET ____ FALSE PROPHET, which I will not allow to interpret the Holy Bible for me.

(28) **The most important question:** Jesus said, "You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess eternal life. These are the ones that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life" (Jn. 5:39,40). The teachings of the _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ cause people to not go to Christ for everlasting life. If you are a Jehovah's witness, will you continue to allow this to happen to you? ____JA ____NEIN.


## Genau wie 1975

Today the _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ claims to be the "faithful and wise servant" of Matt. 24:45-47\. They also teach that Russell never claimed for himself to be that "servant," but said that "servant" was a class of people. The evidence reveals this is only a partial truth! Russell originally taught it was a "class," but obviously changed his mind afterwards and admitted he alone was that "servant" (THE WATCHTOWER, 12-1-16, p. 357). Also, it was openly taught by the _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_, after Russell's death, that he [Russell] was that "servant" (THE WATCHTOWER, 3-1-17, p. 67; THE WATCHTOWER, 12-15-16, Reprints p. 6024)! Why the cover-up about Russell being that "servant"? So the Society can create or abolish doctrine and policy at will and without question. If the Society didn't deny it, then their many publications could only be a rehash of Russell's teachings!


## More Revealing Truth About The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_

In THE WATCHTOWER, 4-1-83, p. 31, the Society addresses Johannes Greber, his involvement in spiritism and his demon-inspired New Testament translation. In that article, they imply from the foreword of his 1980 edition of his N. T., that they just learned about his involvement in spiritism. Is this the truth or just another deception?

The truth is, The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ knew about Johannes Greber and his demon-inspired New Testament since 1956\. This is evident from their expose of him and his translation of the New Testament (THE WATCHTOWER, 2-15-56, pp. 110,111). However, The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ quoted his demon-produced New Testament for backing of their own literature (and **[Jehovah's Witness Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/nwt.html)**) numerous times AFTER 1956 (The Word, Who is He?--According to John, 1962 ed., p. 5; Aid to Bible Understanding, 1971 ed., pp. 1134,1669; Make Sure of All Things, 1965 ed., p. 489; THE WATCHTOWER, 9-15-62, p. 554; THE WATCHTOWER, 10-15-75, p. 640; THE WATCHTOWER, 4-15-76, p. 231). Do you think it was proper for The _Watchtower Bible and Tract Society_ to do this? _____JA _____ NO.
