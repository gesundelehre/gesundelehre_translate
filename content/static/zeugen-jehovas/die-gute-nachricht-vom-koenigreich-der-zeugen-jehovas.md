## The Jehovah's Witnesses 1914 BAD _Good News Of The Kingdom_

**Few Christians have never heard of the [Jehovah's Witnesses](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html), but very few know what they say the _gospel_ (or _good news)_ is. To the Jehovah's Witness the _good news of the kingdom_ is that _the kingdom was established in the heavenlies in 1914!_**

[![good news of the kingdom](../files/pictures/jw-preaching-good-news-of-the-kingdom.jpg "The Jehovah's Witness good news of the kingdom is NOT the real good news mentioned in the Bible!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html)

> Let the honest-hearted person compare the kind of **preaching of the gospel of the Kingdom** done by the religious systems of Christendom during all the centuries with that done by Jehovah's Witnesses since the end of World War I in 1918\. **They are not one and the same kind.** That of Jehovah's Witnesses is really “gospel,” or “good news,” as of **God's heavenly kingdom that was established by the enthronement of his Son Jesus Christ at the end of the Gentile Times in 1914.** (The Watchtower 5/1/81, p.17, emphasis mine)

Are you shocked? That is, in part, what the Jehovah's Witnesses want to convert us over to! One of the ways to help a Jehovah's Witness out of such a delusion is to ask the following two simple questions:


## [The Jehovah's Witnesses _Taking In Knowledge_ is Distorted!](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john173.html)



## Questions For The Jehovah's Witnesses About Their 1914 _Good News Of The Kingdom_

● (1) Did Paul or any of the early disciples ever preach the good news of the kingdom? The answer is a definite _yes._

● (2) Did they ever preach the _good news of the kingdom_ to be that it was (or would be) **_established in the heavenlies in 1914?_** The answer is a definite _no._

■Your comment should then be: Why are you preaching a different gospel, especially since you will be condemned just for that (Gal. 1:8,9)? The Biblical gospel is detailed in 1 Cor. 15:1-4 and Acts 20:21:



## The Real _Good News Of The Kingdom_

The real good news of the kingdom or _gospel_ is the message by which one is _born again_ or spiritually begotten:

> Even though you have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers, **for in Christ Jesus I became your father through [the gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html).** (1 Cor 4:15)

Paul concisely stated his gospel in Acts 20:21, which has nothing to do with the Jehovah's Witness preaching the good news of the kingdom! Furthermore, the gospel message centers around these details:

> Now, brothers, I want to remind you of the gospel I preached to you, which you received and on which you have taken your stand. By this gospel you are saved, **[if you hold firmly](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/scissors.htm)** to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain. For what I received I passed on to you as of first importance : that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures. (1 Cor 15:1-4)

> I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus. (Acts 20:21)

**The seriousness of preaching a worthless 1914 so-called _good news of the kingdom_ like the one the Jehovah's Witnesses declare can't be over-emphasized! It is only through the truth of the real gospel of the kingdom that people get [set free from their sin addictions](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans6.html) when they repent and place a submissive faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. Such is missing from the JW _good news of the kingdom_, which makes it BAD NEWS instead!**
