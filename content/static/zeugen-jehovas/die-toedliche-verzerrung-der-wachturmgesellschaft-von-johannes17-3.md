## _Erkenntnis In Sich Aufnehmen_ Für Ewiges Leben

**Jehovah's Witnesses study Watchtower literature to _take in knowledge!_** Here is why! A very important Scripture to a Jehovah’s Witness regarding _salvation_ is John 17:3, that is, as it reads from their strange so-called “Bible,” **_[The New World Translation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/nwt.html)_**

[![taking in knowledge](../files/pictures/bound-to-jw-taking-in-knowledge.jpg "For the JWs, taking in knowledge means studying the Watchtower literature!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html)

According to their customized translation, John 17:3 reads:

> "Dies bedeutet ewiges Leben, daß sie **<font color="red">fortgesetzt Erkenntnis in sich aufnehmen</font>** über dich, den allein wahren Gott, und über den, den du ausgesandt hast, Jesus Christus." (fette Betonung von mir)

<big><big>**[How To ENSLAVE A Jehovah's Witness](#taking%20in%20knowledge)**</big></big>

**Please know there are no reputable translations that render that verse _taking in knowledge_ like the NWT does**.  So why did the Watchtower Society change the way this verse should be read and understood? Because it is perfectly consistent with what they are trying to declare to others, that is, **only the Watchtower Society located in Brooklyn, New York has the spiritual ability to correctly understand the Scriptures and teach them accurately, and all of this is connected with getting _everlasting life._ That is part of the [Jehovah's Witness mind control](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witness-mind.html) and why the Watchtower can also print that one _must_ be a Jehovah’s Witness for _everlasting life:_**

> You **must** be part of Jehovah’s organization, doing God’s will, in order to receive his blessing of **everlasting life**. (_You Can Live Forever in Paradise on Earth,_ 1982, p. 255).



## The JW _Taking In Knowledge_ Is Impossible

[![erkenntnis in sich aufnehmen](../files/pictures/taking-in-knowledge.jpg "Jehovah's Witnesses are NOT really taking in accurate knowledge!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/nwt.html)

By declaring this false rendering of John 17:3 we notice the following problems for the Jehovah’s Witness:

1\. It contradicts their own Greek-English word for word translation—_The Kingdom Interlinear_ (1969 edition)—which reads _they may be knowing you_ thereby accurately suggesting**a _personal relationship_ with God** instead of just mere academic learning about him**. _Click here to view the [**Kingdom Interlinear**](../files/pictures/jw.jpg)._

Jesus spoke the following to religious unsaved people:

> You diligently study the Scriptures because you think that by them you possess **[eternal life](http://www.eternallifeblog.com/what-is-eternal-life/)**. These are the Scriptures that testify about me, yet **you refuse to come to me to have life**. (John 5:39, 40)

**Similarly, Jehovah’s Witnesses are never told to trust in Jesus 100% for their _salvation_ and ask him [Jesus] in sincere prayer for the _living water_ as he promises to give:**

> Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, **you would have asked him and he would have given you living water**" (John 4:10).

2\. **Their history of changing their own doctrines refutes the concept that Jehovah’s Witness of the past have taken in _accurate knowledge._** **[C. T. Russell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles_russell.html)** taught Jesus is _almighty_ since his resurrection _(**[The Finished Mystery](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/finishedmystery.htm)**,_ Peoples Pulpit Association, 1917, p. 15, comments under Revelation 1:8) which is flatly opposed by JWs of our hour. Many other doctrinal changes have likewise occurred since its beginning.

3\. **Inaccuracies among their teachings are still clearly going on today by their own admittance and show the Jehovah's Witnesses are not really and accurately _taking in knowledge_ as they think!** One glaring example is their emphasis on the **[name _Jehovah_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/name-of-jehovah.html)**, which contradicts their own teaching that Yah-weh is _more correct_ than _Jehovah:_

> While inclining to view the pronunciation **“Yah-weh” as the more correct way**, we have retained the form “Jehovah” because of people’s familiarity with it since the 14<sup>th</sup> century (_The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures_, 1969 ed., p. 23).

Every time a **[Jehovah's Witness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html)** uses the word _Jehovah_ he, therefore, shows he is blindly following the Watchtower Society’s exaltation of _familiarity_ over accuracy. If their bizarre NWT rendering of John 17:3 was true, they would be condemning themselves each time they speak the word _Jehovah_, especially since they also know and even admit the word _Jehovah_ was an invention of a Catholic monk in 1270:

> By combining the vowel signs of '_Adho.nay_ and '_Elo.him_' with the four consonants of the Tetragrammaton the pronunciations _Yeho.wah_' and _Yehowih_' were formed. The first of these provided the basis for the Latinized form “Jehova(h).” The first recorded use of this form dates from the thirteenth century **C.E. Raymundus Martini, a Spanish monk of the Dominican Order,** used it in his book _Pugeo Fidei_ of the year 1270. **Hebrew scholars generally favor “Yahweh” as the most likely pronunciation** _(Aid to Bible Understanding_, **[Watchtower Bible And Tract Society](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jws.htm)**, 1971, pp. 884, 885).

4\. The Greek word _ginosko_ in John 17:3 means _know._ By the Watchtower Society using _knowledge_ instead and inserting the words _take in_, they are able to come up with their NWT rendering of that verse.

If one would compare Matt. 1:25 with John 17:3 and note that _ginosko_ is found in both verses he could easily notice that this term carries a meaning of _intimacy_ and _relationship_ with it. That fact is suggested by _ginosko._ Another related verse showing the meaning of _ginosko_ is this passge:

> We know that we have come to **know** him if we obey his commands. The man who says, "I **know** him," but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him. (1 John 2:3,4)

5\. **How much _knowledge_ does a sinner have to take in before he can find forgiven of sins and eternal life?** Answer: _not very much._ To answer in a different way—how much knowledge did the Philippian jailer take in before he got saved in Acts 16:30-34? Again the answer is the same_._ That is how much we need today. (Not to stray too far off on a tangent, also notice how quickly the Philippian jailer got water baptized after his salvation.) Other examples of how little knowledge one needs to have are shown by the conversion of Zacchaeus (Lk.19:1-9), the tax collector who sincerely prayed _God have mercy on me a sinner_ (Lk. 18:9-14), the unnamed ones along with Cornelius who got saved from the actual salvation sermon cited in Acts 10:34-43, etc.

## _Erkenntnis In Sich Aufnehmen_ Und Sklaverei/Knechtschaft

The Watchtower Society is ensnaring sincere people to a lifelong study of their own literature by twisting the meaning of John 17:3\. The worst part of all of this for those that do get deceived by them is, **they have missed the true understanding of _salvation_ shown in the Bible and, therefore, remain _unsaved_ and _spiritually dead_ in their sins. We have [answered Jehovah's Witnesses](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html) biblically in various ways, showing their errors.**



## John 17:3 and True Biblical Salvation

**True Biblical salvation and forgiveness of sins comes _instantly_ for all who turn from their sins and place a trusting-submitting faith in the Lord Jesus for their soul’s salvation.** This is _**[instant salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/instant_salvation.html)** and the same point which _eternal life_ is received by the repentant, who are now willing to turn from their _idols_ to faithfully serve God to the end (1 Thess. 1:9). Final salvation (or an actual entrance into God’s kingdom) comes for all who endure to the end (Mt. 10:22), hold firmly to the end the confidence they had at first (Heb. 3:14), and remain faithful to the point of death (Rev. 2:10,11). Many who find salvation afterwards lose that precious gift through certain sins, believing/teaching a **[false gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html)** and/or disowning the Lord Jesus during a time of persecution. Some **[backsliders](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/backslider.html)** regain their salvation again and others never do. One major hindrance for salvation is _false prophets_, which is what the Watchtower headquarters of the Jehovah’s Witnesses is.

**Eternal life, besides being a hope (Titus 1:2), yet to be reaped (Gal. 6:8,9) in the age to come (Mk. 10:30), is a gift of God (Rom. 6:23) and present tense possession for those who have the Lord Jesus (1 John 5:12,13). Hence, though [eternal life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternallife.html) is received here and now this side of the grave, there is also an aspect that isn’t received unless we faithfully endure to the end.

Finally, _taking in knowledge_ is NOT true knowledge if it isn't accurate.**
