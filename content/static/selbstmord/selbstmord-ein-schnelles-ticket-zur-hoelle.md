## STOP! Bringe Dich Selber NICHT Um!


**_Suicide_ is commonly defined as _the taking of one's own life._ Tens of thousands of people a year in the United States alone commit suicide, according to a national statistic as of 1993 on suicide:**

> White men run the highest risk of suicide. In fact, they account for almost 75 percent of the **32,000 suicides a year in the United States.**

A different source yielded a slightly lower figure for 1993, but also stated a steady increase in suicides, except for 1992:

![Suizid ist Selbstmord](../../files/pictures/why.jpg)

>  1970 = 23,480 (männlich, 16,629; weiblich, 6,851)  
>  1980 = 26,869 (männlich, 20,505; weiblich, 6,364)  
>  1985 = 29,453 (männlich, 23,145; weiblich, 6,308)  
>  1990 = 30,906 (männlich, 24,724; weiblich, 6,182)  
>  1992 = 30,484 (männlich, 24,457; weiblich, 6,027)  
>  1993 = 31,102 (männlich, 25,007; weiblich, 6,095)  

<big>**[READ THIS! Life Long Temptation For Suicide Ended](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sj.htm)**</big>

Those suicidal statistics show that women are much less apt to commit suicide than men, for some unknown reason.

One must wonder how anyone could consider **murdering himself** (committing suicide). Perhaps one reason for suicide is that these people think they will escape their pain and no longer be aware of anything, just as if they had never been born. There have even been death pacts made resulting in several people successfully murdering themselves together. They didn't realize what they were doing and where they would be heading for eternity, according to Scripture! Otherwise suicidal people would NOT have gone through with it.

Others who have been religiously misled by **[eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** may think a person once saved will escape the agony of their compound painful problems by killing himself by going to heaven. For such a misled person, a heavenly paradise, through suicide, seems appealing and actually **[promotes suicide](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/suicide_testimony.htm)**!

## Wenn Ein Christ Selbstmord Begeht, Kommt Er In Den Himmel?

That's another way of asking if a suicide who was once saved (a Christian) dies as an unrepentant, premeditated murderer, does he go to heaven?

**Remember this, like abortion, _suicide_ is just another name for murder.** However, to be more exact, **suicide is premeditated self-murder.** But even beyond this, **it is the kind of murder one cannot repent of**! Unlike **[King David](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html)**, who had another person murdered but was later forgiven, suicide victims cannot **[repent](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)** to find forgiveness.

## Die EINZIGE Zuverlässige Quelle Bezüglich Suizid

The only reliable source to find out the spiritual facts about life after death, in connection with suicide, is the **[bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)**--God's word to mankind. **Don't be deceived by a [false teacher](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm), all unforgiven murderers, without exception, do not have eternal life and will end up in the [lake of fire](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html):**

> Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that **no murderer has eternal life abiding in him** (1 Jn. 3:15, NKJV).

![Suicide will send you to hell. Don't do it!](../../files/pictures/eternalfire.gif)

> But the cowardly, unbelieving, abominable, **murderers**, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars shall have **their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death** (Rev. 21:8, NKJV).

No exception to the above is made anywhere in Scripture for a person who was once a Christian, then commits suicide because of a bad combination -- painful circumstances, hopelessness and a belief in eternal security (the belief that you can never go to hell once you become a Christian)!

## Mentale Illness und Suizid

Some have tried to excuse the sin of suicide (premeditated self-murder) with the following rationale: _If one is mentally ill, he isn't responsible for his actions._ **To excuse any form of murder this way, including self-murder, is not Scriptural. There is absolutely no Biblical backing for such a statement**! Besides, mental illness isn't the root of sin, the **heart** of man is. Jesus tells us where _murder_ proceeds from:

> What comes out of a man is what makes him unclean. For from **within, out of men's hearts come** evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, **murder**, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, lewdness, envy, slander, arrogance and folly. All these evils come from inside and make a man 'unclean' (Mk. 7:20-23, NIV).

**Please note that _murder_ (regardless the form) comes from the _heart_ und ist laut dem Herrn keine geistige Krankheit!**

![Two people in hell fire. One was a suicide victim.](../../files/pictures/pic11.jpg)

Such people who yield to this temptation won't be going to heaven, since they committed **murder** and couldn't repent of it!

It is vitally important that suicide, like other satanic temptations, be steadfastly resisted. In other words, **don't even for a moment entertain suicidal thoughts.** Anyone who yields to this satanic temptation of murder, and becomes a suicide, will only be intensifying their own pain and misery in eternity, not escaping it! People in hell at this moment because of suicide would do anything to have the chance you have to reverse their actions but can't. It's too late forever for them.

Lasting hope and peace can be found only in the Lord Jesus. If you were once saved, but have backslidden to the point where you are thinking about suicide, please repent and read these **[safeguards](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/safegard.html)** for your soul and put them into practice.

## <font color="magenta">The True Plan of Salvation For The Suicidal and Everyone</font>

The true plan of salvation is repentance towards God and faith in Christ Jesus (Acts 20:21). We prove our repentance by our deeds (Acts 26:20). The Lord Jesus taught the road to life is **"hard"** and only a **"few"** will find it (Mt. 7:13,14, NKJV). Many get saved, but afterwards fall away (Lk. 8:13; Jn. 6:66; 1 Tim. 1:19; etc.). In other words, after initial salvation we must endure to the **"end"** to enter the kingdom of God and escape the lake of fire (Mt. 10:22; Heb. 3:14; Rev. 2:10,11). Eternal life comes to the repentant the moment such believe on Jesus for salvation (Jn. 3:16; 6:47; 1 Jn. 5:12,13), but there is another important aspect of eternal life that many are totally unware of in our day because of the false teaching of eternal security. **According to true grace teaching, eternal life is also a HOPE (Titus 3:7), yet to be REAPED (Gal. 6:8,9) in the AGE TO COME (Mk. 10:30) for only the ones who PERSIST IN DOING GOOD (Rom. 2:7) and DO NOT GROW WEARY AND GIVE UP (Gal. 6:9).**
