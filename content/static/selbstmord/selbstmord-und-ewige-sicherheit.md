## These Are The Possible Thoughts of a Suicidal Eternal Security Proponent

**_Suicide_ is a terrible problem throughout the world. People commit suicide for various reasons, but certainly the ones who do don't realize the spiritual impact it will have on them to die in such a condition. [This page is provided primarily to STOP suicides from occurring.]**

![A woman being set up for self murder](../files/pictures/woman1.jpg)

I hate this miserable life. Nothing ever goes right.
 I'm about to get laid off, my marriage is falling apart, my health 
is failing, and I can't stand my kids.

* * *

![A woman voicing her deceptions](../files/pictures/woman2.jpg)

I thought when I got saved everything would be 
smooth sailing. At least that's what they implied. Were they ever 
wrong!

* * *

![Now she is DANGEROUSLY thinking about suicide](../files/pictures/woman3.jpg)

Life isn't worth living anymore. I think I'll kill myself 
and go home to be with the Lord (that is, if **[eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** is true).

* * *

![Once saved always saved leads to suicide](../files/pictures/woman4.jpg)

If only I was sure I would go to Heaven, I would do it.
 But I heard one person once say I'd go to **[Hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html)** for murdering myself.

* * *

![She is still toying with the devil's thoughts about suicide](../files/pictures/woman5.jpg)

So, why should I believe all those Bible verses he 
quoted? All the big-name, popular teachers claim murderers go 
to Heaven, if they were ever saved. After all, didn't Samson 
commit suicide?

* * *

![She doesn't know what eternal salvation is or about the heresy of eternal security](../files/pictures/woman6.jpg)

Aren't all my sins already forgiven - past, present 
and future, like **[Charles Stanley](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-stanley.html)** teaches? And [**suicide**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/suicide.html) is not the 
**[unpardonable sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal_sin_blasphemy_of_Holy_Spirit.html)**. God will understand since He loves me.

* * *

![Eternal security has convinced her to commit suicide](../files/pictures/woman7.jpg)

That's the answer! Would those eternal security 
teachers ever lead me wrong? I'll just ignore those legalistic Bible 
verses I heard to the contrary since we are saved by grace, not by 
works! Where's my gun?

# **<font color="magenta">STOP!</font>**

Don't pull the trigger! Don't be deceived by the popular false teachers of our day, who have distorted the meaning of [**grace**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/true-grace-false-grace.html), eternal salvation, eternal life, etc.! The **[Sovereign God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sovereignty-of-god.html)** Himself, who spoke the words in Rev. 21:8 after the infinite work of the Lord Jesus on the cross, knows more about His own love, eternal salvation, grace, faithfulness and keeping power than the ear ticklers of our day (2 Tim. 4:3,4). God personally stated that those listed will go the lake of fire, not Heaven, even if they once had a moment of true faith! He said this:

> But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, **the MURDERERS**, the sexually immoral, those who practice **[magic arts](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/occult.html)**, the idolaters and all liars - **their place will be in the FIERY LAKE OF BURNING SULFUR.** This is the second death (Rev. 21:8).

And remember this: "suicide" is just another name for self-murder, but it is still murder! That makes suicides, murderers, who are incapable of repenting of their premeditated murder.

The Apostle John taught:

> ... and ye know that **no MURDERER hath eternal life abiding in him** (1 Jn. 3:15).

With the clarity of those two Scriptures, one can't help but wonder how such a teaching that suicides go to heaven can be tolerated by those who own **[Bibles](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)**, but somehow it is. Probably because it is consistent with the popular doctrine of eternal security - a false teaching that has spread like gangrene, to the eternal detriment of multitudes of precious souls.

Please know this age is cursed because of Adam's sin (Gen. 3). It is currently a dark world with spiritual forces of evil in it (Eph. 6:12). It is not the Christian's home but a spiritual battlefield, where we undergo various forms of testings (Jam. 1:12; Job 7:18; Isa. 48:10; Heb. 11:17). This life is not ideal for anyone, especially the godly (2 Tim. 3:12)!

Don't ever entertain the thought of suicide for even one moment. Resist those thoughts as any other thought from the **[devil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html)**, who is trying to destroy you. Instead, fill your mind with Scripture and meditate on them throughout the day. Endure hardship as a good soldier (2 Tim. 2:3). Paradise is for the overcomers, that is, **[salvation eternal life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/getsaved.html)**, joy, peace, no pain, etc. You must OBEY Jesus to have eternal salvation. Self-murder is disobedience.

As 2+2=4, the teaching of eternal security leads to various forms of immorality. The truth is, **we must endure to the end, live holy lives and bring forth good fruit to enter God's paradise kingdom** (Mt. 10:22; Lk. 13:6-9; Heb. 3:14; 12:14; Mt. 5:8) where there will be no more death, mourning, crying or pain of any kind (Rev. 21:4; Isa. 35:10).

By the way, Samson didn't commit suicide and our **[future sins are not forgiven before we commit them](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/futuresins.html)**. Furthermore, though suicide is not the unpardonable sin, it doesn't have to be to damn one's eternal soul - his most valuable possession. SO DON'T BE DECEIVED BY THE **[ETERNAL SECURITY TEACHERS](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html)**.
