## Vom Ouija Brett und Hexerei zu JESUS

It was a warm sunny day ... My husband ... was occupying the free-speech area while I went for a walk. Under the breezeway I could not help but see a lengthy line of young people waiting for something. As I walked to the beginning of this long line, I noticed a big neon sign that read, "PSYCHIC FAIR."

[![Witchcraft is condemned by the Scriptures](../files/pictures//witch2.png)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritist.html)

Oh, when I saw this, my heart started pounding, and I knew that the Lord wanted me to say something. I opened up my Bible to Deut. 18 (see footnote at the end) and loudly proclaimed how abominable these psychics are to a Holy and Righteous God.

One of the psychics got up in my face and opposed me. After a few more moments exhorting these students not to participate in such demonic activity, I went back to the free-speech area where my husband was preaching. [My husband] then went back to that breezeway looking for that long line of students but only found a few. Praise the Lord, those people were now outside listening to the **[Gospel of Jesus Christ](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)**! **Little did those students know that I was speaking from personal experience ...** Jesus said,

> "What I tell you in darkness, that <u>speak ye in light</u>: and what ye hear in the ear, that <u>preach ye upon the housetops</u>. And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul: but rather fear him [God] which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell." (Matt. 10:27-28)

## Dabbling Into the Occult

[![witchcraft ouija board](../files/pictures/ouija-board-witchcraft-spiritism.jpg "Witchcraft opens one up to DEMONIC ACTIVITY")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ouija2.html)

I was born and raised in ... I had no Christian background or knowledge of the Bible. ... is mainly a Roman Catholic country, though many of these **[Catholic Churches](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html)** are a mixture of voodoo and Catholicism.

Finances? Career? Romance? Loss of a loved one? Many people start their experience with the occult by consulting a **palm reader**, a **card reader**, the **pendulum**, or calling the **psychic** on the phone. Some cannot start the day off without reading their **horoscope** in the newspaper. Others get involved in "health alternatives" meddling with **pyramids** and **crystals, yoga,** or **transcendental meditation**. A few even start off playing a game such as **"Dungeons and Dragons"** or with a strange **[curiosity about UFOs](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/aliens-and-religion.html)**and get right into **New Age.**

I've experimented with most of these things, but my experience with the occult really started with the **Ouija Board.** I thought that I was just playing and having fun, **but I was ignorantly opening my life and my parents' house to all types of demonic activities. <u>If you take part of any occultic activity, you open up your life for demonic activity too</u>**.

> **"Be sober, be vigilant; because your [adversary the devil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html), as a roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour"** (1 Pet 5:8).

**It was fun and "innocent" in the beginning, but after a while my brother and I started seeing shadows in the form of a man's silhouette running through our house and into a wall. There were noises in the kitchen, stairway, and living room. One time I was standing in the living room by myself and I heard footsteps of someone's shoes on the wooden floor. These steps kept getting closer and closer to me and I could even "see" where they were approaching me, but nobody was there.** I was so bound by **fear** that I could no longer sleep in the dark. Several times I **heard someone heavily breathing into my ear - with no one in sight.** I was so terrified that I became **sick, anorexic, depressed,** and **suicidal.** We used a glass to do the Ouija Board ... and one day I met a friend from Argentina who relayed her **[Ouija Board](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ouija2.html)** experience. She told me how the demon was so infuriated one day that the glass flew in the air, exploding without anyone touching it.

## If You Shake Hands With the Devil, He Will Bite Your Arm Off!

Being in such bondage of fear, I went to the only place I knew to go for help: to the voodoo church. Wrong choice. They were kind and nice to me and told me that all my troubles were coming from my uncle, who had just passed away (**necromancy**). He really loved me, they said, and in efforts to protect me he was spooking me. The cure would be a vegetable bath and chicken sacrifice. They told me to buy different types of vegetables -- potatoes, green beans, pinto beans, carrots, etc.-- some black and red satin cloth, candles, white roses, and a chicken. When I went back to the voodoo church, they had me stand fully clothed in white apparel on the black and red cloths, while they threw the chopped up vegetables over my head and chanted. At the end of the afternoon, they took the chicken and sacrificed it somewhere, leaving it with burning candles and roses. To my surprise, things got better. All the noises and strange occurrences in our home slowed down. Of course, the devil wanted me to think that whatever they did to me really worked to keep me coming back.

> **"And no marvel; for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light."** (2 Cor 11:14)

I could tell you other things I've seen, such as the witch doctors performing surgery, people channeling "deceased entities," and other stories that would make your hair stand up.

## When Jesus Set Me Free

Meanwhile, I was taking English Classes all through High School ... When I graduated, I became an exchange student. I was matched with a family ... I arrived to their home on Jan. 16, 1989 and started going to ... High School for a 6-month exchange program to learn English and live the American culture.

The family who took me in was a church going family. I was so shocked and impressed by the fact that they would bow their heads and ask the blessing over the food before they ate. The smallest things they did left a great impression in me. I was required to go to church with them and do whatever they did as a family. Someone gave me a Bible - **MY VERY FIRST BIBLE!!!** - which I started to devour. I could not believe that I had the Words of God sitting upon my lap! I would stay up until late at night after doing homework with a little ... Dictionary on one side, and a big Webster's Dictionary on the other. My English was so bad that it would take me a whole hour to read through a few verses, looking up every other word in the dictionary. I would keep a notepad next to me and write questions from my Bible reading, then bog down the Sunday School teacher with all my questions the next Sunday.

> **"The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple. I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy commandments."** (Psa 119:130-131)

Finally, on March 19, 1989, I made the decision that I needed to be born again. I knew that I was evil, headed to Hell for all of my sins. I was ready to **[forsake all known sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)** for a new life in Christ, and to renounce all of my involvement with the **[occult](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/occult.html)**. I talked to my Sunday School teacher and asked her how. At the end of the sermon, she grabbed my hand and down we went. We knelt down at the altar with the pastor and after a moment of prayer I cannot explain in human words what happened to me. All I know is that for the first time I experienced waves of peace flooding my soul. All the fear in my life was now GONE!!!

> **"There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear: because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect in love."** (1 John 4:18)

**That was the first time in years that I was able to sleep with the lights off.**

> **"When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet."** (Prov 3:24)

**I was FREE - free from all worry, free from all guilt, free from all shame. I was free to begin a new, obedient life in Christ. One drop of that precious blood was enough to [break all demonic bondage from my life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans6.html), forgiving me of all my heinous, satanic sins, and separating my sins from me as far as the east is from the west. Oh, the blessedness of having a clear conscience and peace with God!**

> **"As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us"** (Psa 103:12)

I was deceived by many of the practices of the occult because they had a cloak of righteousness (i.e. the approval of the Roman Catholic Church) but were actually doorways for the devil into my life. You may not be sacrificing chickens, but **if you are seeking guidance outside of Biblical ways, prayer in the name of Jesus, and the Word of God, I can tell you without a doubt that what you are involved in is occultic, whether our society (or even your church) says it is right or not.** The Bible says,

> **"Blessed is the man that walketh not in the <u>counsel of the ungodly</u>** [psychics, paranormals], **nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful. But his delight is in the <u>law of the LORD</u>; and in his law doth he meditate day and night"** (Psa. 1:1-2).

God has given me a wonderful husband and has put us in the ministry ... trying to bring others to the same knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ for the glory of God. It has now been many years, and the only regret I have is that I hadn't known the joy of loving Christ before.

## Warte Nicht Bis es zu Spät Ist.

> Deu 18:10-12
>  "There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth **divination** [foretelling of future events by the aid of other than natural means], or an **observer of times** [horoscopes], or an **enchanter** [one who uses the magic arts, spells or charms], or a **witch** [a woman who practices sorcery or enchantment], or a **charmer** [one that practices **[sorcery](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritism.htm)** through charms], or a **consulter with familiar spirits** [a medium or channeler], or a **wizard** [a male witch], or a **necromancer** [one who communicates with the dead]. For all that do these things are an **<u>ABOMINATION</u>** unto the LORD: and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive them out from before thee."

> Isa 47:12-14
>  "Stand now with thine **enchantments,** and with the multitude of thy **sorceries,** wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail. Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the **astrologers,** the **stargazers,** the **monthly prognosticators**, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee. Behold, <u>they shall be as stubble</u>; the <u>fire shall burn them</u>; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame."
