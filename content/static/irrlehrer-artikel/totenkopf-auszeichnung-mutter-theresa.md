## The Real Mother Teresa Unvarnished

**Mother Teresa (1910-1997) was a woman who spent much of her life helping the very poor, but she was also a [Rosary](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/rosary.html)-reciting Catholic nun, who embraced the [standard Catholic doctrines](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/official.html). Do you think, therefore, she could have been promoting God’s truth, as found in the [Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)? Decide for yourself. The following are various statements either by or about Mother Teresa. They are very revealing regarding this:**

[![Mother Teresa](../../files/pictures/motherteresa-rosary.jpg)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/rosary.html)

> “All is God—Buddhists, Hindus, Christians, etc., all have access to the same God.” (12/4/89 Time Magazine Interview with Edward Desmond, pp. 11, 13)

> “If in coming face to face with **[God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.html)** we accept Him in our lives, then we are converting. We become a better Hindu, a better Muslim, a better Catholic, a better whatever we are .... What God is in your mind you must accept” (from Mother Teresa: Her People and Her Work, by Desmond Doig, [Harper & Row, 1976, p.156]).

> “I convert you to be a better Hindu or a better Muslim or a better Protestant. Once you’ve found God, it’s up to you to decide how to worship him.” (“Mother Teresa Touched Other Faiths,” AP, Sept. 7, 1997).

> “I’ve always said we should help a Hindu become a better Hindu, a Muslim become a better Muslim, a Catholic become a better Catholic” (A Simple Path, p. 31).

> “If the individual thinks and believes that his or her way is the only way to God, then that is **their way of salvation” (pp. 74-75). (Mark Michael Zima, Mother Teresa: The Case for the Cause)

> “At the word of a priest, that little piece of bread becomes the body of Christ ... Then you give this bread to us, so that we too might live and become holy ...” (Mother Teresa’s speech made at the Worldwide Retreat for Priests, Oct. 1984)

> “When the priest is there, then can we have our altar and our tabernacle and our Jesus. Only the priests put Jesus there for us .… Jesus wants to go there, but we cannot bring him unless you first give him to us. This is why I love priests so much. We could never be what we are and do the things we do without you priests who first bring Jesus to us.” (Ibid)

> “So let us ask the help of our Lady! She is a Mother full of grace, full of God, full of Jesus. Let us ask her to be our Mother, guiding us and protecting us .... It is true that we are already being helped by our tremendous **[devotion to Mary](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devotion-to-mary.htm)**. She is our patroness and our Mother, and she is always leading us to Jesus” (Mother Teresa, Be Holy, p. 75).

> “Again that great crowd—I could see great sorrow and suffering in their faces—I was kneeling near Our Lady, who was facing them. — … I heard her say, ‘Take care of them—they are mine—bring them to Jesus—Carry Jesus to them—Fear not. **Teach them to say the Rosary—the family Rosary and all will be well. —Fear not—Jesus and I will be with you and your children’” (Mother Teresa: Come Be My Light, p. 99).

> A co-worker of Mother Teresa’s was asked this question: “These people are waiting to die. What are you telling them to prepare them for death and eternity?” Mother Teresa’s co-worker (a nun) stated, “We tell them to pray to their Bhagwan, to their gods.” (Interview with Christian News)

> The April 7-13, 1990, issue of Radio Times tells the story of Mother Teresa taking care of a dying Hindu priest. “She nursed him with her own hands and helped him to die reconciled with his own gods.”

How discouraging and misleading it is to hear professing **[Christians](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html)** speak of Mother Teresa as though she was the epitome of what a Christian should be. Though **[Mother Teresa](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/motherteresa.htm)** was compassionate, she clearly was not Biblically sound nor did she promote God's truth. Sadly, I can find no evidence that she ever changed. GOD BLESS YOU.
