## Charles Spurgeon's _Defense of Calvinism_ REFUTED With Scripture and Logic

[![charles spurgeon's defense of calvinism](../../files/pictures/charles-spurgeon-defense-of-calvinism.jpg "Charles Spurgeon Was NOT The Prince of Preachers.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html)

**Charles Haddon Spurgeon** (1834-1892) was a famous Baptist minister who, among other things, pastored the Metropolitan Tabernacle in London smoked cigars* and wrote a so-called _Defense Of Calvinism_ which has been used over the years for support of that theology. [*This fact about his cigar smoking has been concealed in our day, but the older pre-1940 Charles Spurgeon biographies include a chapter on his smoking. See quote regarding this at the end of this article.] One hundred years after his death, Charles Spurgeon is still favorably quoted and much respected by the uninformed, present-day church crowd. As you will learn, **Charles Spurgeon was not biblically sound or logical.**

![Charles Spurgeon defense of calvinism](../../files/pictures/spurgeon.jpg "Charles Spurgeon was a cigar smoking irrational Calvinist.")

Because Charles Spurgeon wrote an article entitled, _A Defense Of Calvinism_ and that same article is sometimes submitted as proof for that theological system, it must, therefore, be _tested_ (1 Thess. 5:21) with the Scriptures, which is final authority for the Christian (2 Tim. 3:16,17). Below are my findings.


## Charles Spurgeon's Quote About Calvinism and Arminianism

[All quotes from Charles Spurgeon are from _The Autobiography of Charles H. Spurgeon,_ Curts & Jennings, Cincinnati -- Chicago -- St. Louis, 1898, Vol. I. All quotes from John Calvin are from _Institutes of the Christian Religion,_ Eerdmans Publishing Co., 1989, translated by Henry Beveridge.]

## I. Charles Spurgeon shockingly declared Calvinism is _the [gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/whichgospel.htm)_ and Arminianism is _heresy:_

> And what is **the heresy of Arminianism** but the addition of something to the work of the Redeemer? Every **heresy**, if brought to the touchstone, will discover itself here. I have my own private opinion that there is no such thing as preaching Christ and Him crucified, **unless we preach what nowadays is called Calvinism**. It is a nickname to call it Calvinism; **Calvinism is the gospel, and nothing else** (p. 172)

COMMENT: Everyone who knows that the Bible does not teach Calvinism needs to be informed that Charles Spurgeon believed this way, BEFORE they are tempted to favorably quote Charles Spurgeon as an authority in a sermon, article, private conversation, etc! **For Charles Spurgeon to declare Calvinism as _the gospel_ and Arminianism as _heresy_ immediately reflects his overall darkened understanding of the entire Scriptures!** Proof for this statement will soon be shown.

## II. Charles Spurgeon denied a basic Scriptural truth about _falling away_ taught by the Lord Jesus and further added that he _abhor[s]_ such a message:

> ... nor can I comprehend a gospel which lets saints **fall away** after they are called, and suffers the children of God to be burned in the fires of damnation after having once believed in Jesus. Such a gospel **I abhor** (p. 172).


## What Does The Bible Teach About _Falling Away?_

![Charles Spurgeon defense of calvinism prince of preachers smoked cigars](../../files/pictures/cigar3.gif "Charles Spurgeon was a cigar smoking irrational Calvinist")

> "You will all **fall away**," Jesus told them, - for it is written: 'I will strike the shepherd, and **the sheep** will be scattered.' But after I have risen, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.' Peter declared, 'Even if all **fall away**, I will not.' 'I tell you the truth,' Jesus answered, 'today yes, tonight before the rooster crows twice you yourself will disown me three times.' But Peter insisted emphatically, 'Even if I have to die with you, I will never disown you.' And all the others said the same (Mark 14:27-31, NIV).

The KJV renders the words _fall away_ in Mark 14:27 as _offended_ and the NKJV translates this as _stumble_. **The reader should be advised that it is the same Greek word found in Mk. 4:17, and the same person of Luke 8:13 where both the KJV and NKJV use _fall away_:**

> But the ones on the rock are those who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of temptation **fall away** (NKJV).

> They on the rock _are they,_ which, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, which for a while believe, and in time of temptation **fall away** (KJV).

These Scriptures prove that the Lord's apostles (or _saints_) did _fall away_ after they were _called_, with Peter disowning Jesus three times. Though those eleven apostles all came back to the Lord, others like [**Solomon**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/solomons-apostasy.html) and Saul, turned away and **never** returned. **Charles Spurgeon, by his own admittance, _abhors_ this Scriptural truth! Remember this the next time you hear the name, _Charles Spurgeon_.**

Getting back to Luke 8:13, also remember that Jesus taught people _fall away_ after they [**believe**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/believing.html). In other words, it is impossible to _fall away_ unless one first believes. This is Jesus' interpretation and is not open to another's, including from Charles Spurgeon.

Charles Spurgeon can't comprehend _a gospel_ which lets saints fall away after they are called. But the real _gospel,_ as outlined in the Scriptures and which Paul preached, states that a [**Christian**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html) can even believe in vain:

> Moreover, brethren, I declare to you **the gospel** which I preached to you, which also you received and in which you stand, by which also you are saved, **if you hold fast that word which I preached to you; unless you believed in vain**. For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that He rose again the third day according to the Scriptures (1 Cor. 15:1-4, NKJV).

Clearly then, unlike what Charles Spurgeon taught, **there are conditions attached to the real gospel of grace.** Furthermore, **it is definitely possible for a real Christian to _believe in vain,_** according to the word of God. This also makes the following Charles Spurgeon quote wrong since the Apostle Paul did NOT preach, as he represents him:

> The old truth that [**Calvin**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/johncalvin.html) preached, that [**Augustine**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/augustineprayer.htm) preached, that Paul preached, is the truth that I must preach today, or else be false to my conscience and my God (p. 167).

(Many other Scriptures could be cited which prove the Bible teaches that the believer's security is conditional. For a much more exhaustive answer on this, see our 801 page book entitled, [_**The Believer's Conditional Security</font>**_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelical-books.html). Contact us at: Evangelical Outreach, PO Box 265, Washington, PA 15301 or order at [**Evangelical Books**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelical-books.html). **Our book also documents that [**Augustine**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/augustineprayer.htm) believed in Purgatory and promoted Mary worship. This was the real, unvarnished Augustine from whom [**John Calvin**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/michael-servetus.html) drew his doctrines and who Charles Spurgeon shockingly exalts as the intermediate link to the Apostle Paul!) Charles Spurgeon was shockingly WRONG!**


## III. Charles Spurgeon was so convinced about the Calvinistic view of _falling away_ that he strangely concluded that _the Bible is a lie_ and he himself will become an _infidel,_ if he ever came to believe that even one saint of God has ever _fall[en] finally:_

> If one dear saint of God had perished, so might all; if one of the covenant ones be lost, so may all be; and then there is no gospel promise true, but **the Bible is a lie**, and there is nothing in it worth my acceptance. **I will be an infidel at once when I can believe that a saint of God can ever fall finally** (p. 172).

COMMENT: Of course, the Bible is not a _lie,_ but instead the proven [**word of the living God**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wordgod.html). All Calvinist Charles Spurgeon needed to do was accept the clear teaching of Scripture on the believer's security, as upsetting as it might be to him. Charles Spurgeon and other [**once saved always saved teachers**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html) are actually placing a snare before all who listen to their message of an unconditional security for the believer. Please note what the Scriptures teach about an extreme, over sense of security, as Charles Spurgeon was declaring:

> Therefore let him who thinks he stands take heed **lest he fall** (1 Cor. 10:12, NKJV).


## Do Not Be Haughty, But Fear

Moreover, true grace teaching declares the following:

> "You will say then, 'Branches were broken off that I might be grafted in.' Well said. Because of unbelief they were broken off, and you **stand by faith. Do not be haughty, but fear.** For if God did not spare the natural branches, **He may not spare you either**. Therefore consider the goodness and severity of God: on those who fell, severity; but toward you, goodness, **if you continue in _His_ goodness. Otherwise you also will be cut off**. And they also, if they do not continue in unbelief, will be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in **again**" (Rom. 11:19-23, NKJV).


## IV. By his own admittance, Charles Spurgeon's personal belief in the Calvinistic doctrine of the "perseverance of the saints" prevented him from becoming _of all men most miserable:_

> I do not know how some people, who believe that **a Christian can fall from grace, manage to be happy**. It must be a very commendable thing in them to be able to get through a day without despair. **If I did not believe the doctrine of the final perseverance of the saints, I think I should be of all men the most miserable**, because I should lack any ground of comfort (p. 173).

COMMENT: **Dear friend, please know that _truth_ as recorded in the Bible, and not what makes us _happy_ should be our quest. In contrast, Charles Spurgeon exalted _happiness_ over Bible truth!** Some doctrines in the Bible are disturbing, like eternal, conscious torment awaiting the lost beyond the grave, but it is still true. **Truth is what will set us free (John 8:32).**

Also, Charles Spurgeon's doctrine took part of a Scripture from the KJV out of context and connected it to the Calvinistic _perseverance of the saints,_ a teaching which is not found in Scripture. Below is what the Apostle Paul actually wrote and which Charles Spurgeon used out of context:

> If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are **of all men most miserable** (1 Cor. 15:19, KJV).

Paul was teaching there that a Christian's _hope in_ Christ, extends beyond the grave and is in no way even slightly connected to the _perseverance of the saints,_ as Charles Spurgeon misused Scripture to suggest. Furthermore, as already cited, Charles Spurgeon wrote:

> It must be a very commendable thing in them [Christians who believe they can _fall from grace_] to be able to get through a day without despair.

But Paul and the other early Christians were not overcome with _despair,_ as Charles Spurgeon suggests should come to rejecters of the _perseverance of the saints_ doctrine as they were. Instead, they walked in the fear of God themselves, as they also _worked out their salvation with fear and trembling:_

> Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, **work out your own salvation with fear and trembling** (Phil. 2:12, KJV).

Regarding _falling from grace,_ the apostle Paul clearly believed such did occur to some of the Galatians, who were at that same point, _alienated from Christ:_

> Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, **Christ will be of no value to you at all.** Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. You who are trying to be justified by law have been **alienated from Christ; you have fallen away from grace** (Gal. 5:2-4, NIV).


## <a name="charles%20spurgeon%20grace"></a>Calvinism's _Evanescent Grace_

How could Charles Spurgeon, or any Calvinist, truly be sure of Heaven himself? Though Charles Spurgeon and others might speak or write of salvation assurance, such really isn't consistent with Calvinism! According to that theology, Charles Spurgeon and other Calvinists might have been merely reprobates all along and have only been given by God an _evanescent grace,_ as Calvin termed it:

> ... Experience shows that **the reprobate are sometimes affected in a way so similar to the elect that even in their own judgment there is no difference between them**. Hence, it is not strange, that by the Apostle a taste of heavenly gifts, and by Christ himself **a temporary faith is ascribed to them**. Not that they truly perceive the power of spiritual grace and the sure light of faith; but **the Lord**, the better to convict them, and leave them without excuse, **instills into their minds such a sense of goodness as can be felt without the Spirit of adoption** .... there is a great resemblance and affinity between the elect of God and those who are impressed for a time with a fading faith .... Still it is correctly said, that the reprobate believe God to be propitious to them, inasmuch as they accept the gift of reconciliation, though confusedly and without due discernment; not that they are partakers of the same faith or regeneration with the children of God; but because, under a covering of hypocrisy **they seem to have a principle of faith in common with them. Nor do I even deny that God illumines their mind to this extent** .... there is nothing inconsistent in this with the fact of **his enlightening some with a present sense of grace, which afterwards proves evanescent**(3.2.11, _Institutes_).

In light of John Calvin's teaching (which Charles Spurgeon agreed with), the salvation assurance that all Calvinists speak of is merely **empty words**, since they won't really know **until the very end of their lives if they were elect or not**! Perhaps God just granted them an **_evanescent grace_** in which they feel saved but really aren't. **[By this teaching, Calvinists shockingly portray the God who _cannot lie_**(Titus 1:2) **as forcing untrue feelings on some people, in order to deceive them!]**

**<big>See also [Calvinism Refuted](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html)</big>**


## V. Charles Spurgeon clearly contradicts the message of Scripture again! This time Charles Spurgeon taught there will be _more_ people in Heaven than in hell:

> **I believe there will be more in Heaven than in hell**. If anyone asks me why I think so, I answer, **because Christ, in everything, is to 'have the pre-eminence**,' and I cannot conceive how He could have the pre-eminence if there are to be more in the dominions of Satan than in Paradise (p. 174).


## The Lord Jesus Taught The MAJORITY Will Perish!

> Enter by the narrow gate; for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leads to **destruction**, and there are **<u>MANY</u> who go in by it**. Because narrow _is_ the gate and difficult is the way which leads to **life**, and there are **<u>FEW</u>** who find it (Mt. 7:13,14, NKJV).

COMMENT: According to the Lord Jesus (and in contrast to Charles Spurgeon), there are only two groups of people with **_many_ of them going to destruction, and only few being saved in the end**. Furthermore, the _wide_ gate and _broad_ way leading to _destruction_ also implies that more people are on that road and will enter through that _gate_ into that eternal destiny than will enter the _narrow_ gate into life. Dear reader, if **YOU** are like most people, you too are on your way to eternal damnation. **If so, you need to turn from your sins and put your faith in Jesus for your salvation, Acts 20:21\. Also, it is ONLY a trusting, submitting and ENDURING faith in the Lord Jesus that will bring us into God's Kingdom:**

> And you will be hated by all for My name's sake. But he who endures to **the end** will be saved (Mt. 10:22, NKJV).

> For we have become partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to **the end** (Heb. 3:14, NKJV).

> Do not fear any of those things which you are about to suffer. Indeed, the [**devil**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html) is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful **until death**, and I will give you the [**crown of life**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/crown.html). He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. [**He who overcomes**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/he-who-overcomes.html) shall not be hurt by **the second death** (Rev. 2:10,11, NKJV).

**Please note: _the second death_ is another name for the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8). So being _faithful until death_ is necessary for salvation's sake, according to the Lord Jesus.** **The teaching of [**once saved always saved**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html), eternal security or the perseverance of the saints can NOT be true, according to the Bible. So don't be deceived by Charles Spurgeon teaching it.**

Furthermore, Charles Spurgeon again used a Scriptural clause about Christ _having the pre-eminence_ for his _defense of Calvinism._ Notice how it is actually cited in the Scriptures (and different from how Charles Spurgeon used it):

> "And he is the head of the body, the church: who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead; that in all _things_ he might **have the preeminence**" (Col. 1:18, KJV).

The context of that verse reveals that Charles Spurgeon has again misused Scripture for his own purpose and faulty _defense_ of a false theology.


## VI. Charles Spurgeon contradicts John Calvin's teaching about the non-elect infants being damned to Hell, even though he considers himself a Calvinist and Calvinism as _the gospel:_

> I rejoice to know that **the souls of all infants, as soon as they die, speed their way to Paradise** (p. 175).

But John Calvin did NOT teach that _all infants_ go to Paradise upon death! In contrast to Charles Spurgeon, John Calvin taught that non-elect infants would be _condemned:_

> Hence, even **infants** bringing **their condemnation with them from their mother's womb**, suffer not for another's, but for their own defect. For although they have not yet produced the fruits of their own unrighteousness, they have the seed implanted in them. Nay, their whole nature is, as it were, a seed-bed of sin, and therefore cannot but be **odious and abominable to God.** Hence, it follows, that it is properly deemed sinful in the sight of God; for there could be no **condemnation** without guilt (2.1.8\. _Institutes_).

> I again ask how it is that the fall of Adam involves so many nations with their **infants children** in **eternal death without remedy**, unless that it so seemed meet to God? (3.23.7\. _Institutes_).

At this point, Charles Spurgeon's _Defense of Calvinism_ seems to be more like a [**refutation to Calvinism**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html). Moreover, Charles Spurgeon opposed [**infant baptism**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/infantbaptism.htm), which Calvin believed in:

> In 1864, he preached a sermon **against infant baptism** and offended a large group of evangelicals who had been his supporters.

Regarding infant baptism, Calvin taught the following:

> Everyone must now see that [**paedobaptism**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/infantbaptism.htm), which receives such strong support from Scripture, is by no means of human invention.


## VII. Charles Spurgeon considers Scriptural truth that Jesus died for ALL people who ever lived to be _the most monstrous iniquity_ that could be imputed to a pagan deity!

> **That Christ should offer an atonement and satisfaction for the sins of all men**, and that afterwards some of those very men should be punished for the sins of which Christ had already atoned, appears to me to be **the most monstrous iniquity that could ever have been imputed to Saturn, to Janus, to the goddess of the Thugs, or to the most diabolical heathen deities.** God forbid that we should ever think thus of Jehovah, the just and wise and good! (pp. 175,176).

COMMENT: **Charles Spurgeon, and other Calvinists, deny the truth of the infinite work of Christ** as extending to all people, even those who will be lost in the end. Below are a few Scriptures which reveal Charles Spurgeon's definite error:

> All we like sheep have gone astray; We have turned, every one, to his own way; And **the LORD has laid on Him the iniquity of us all** (Isa. 53:6, NKJV).

> But there were [**false prophets**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm) also among the people, even as there shall be **false teachers** among you, who privily shall bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord **that bought them**, and bring upon themselves swift destruction (2 Pet. 2:1, KJV).

> And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but **also for the whole world** (1 Jn. 2:2, NKJV).

> For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ **died for the ungodly** (Rom. 5:6, NKJV).

COMMENT: Regarding Rom. 5:6, for Charles Spurgeon or any Calvinist to embrace a view of _grace_ and the atonement that will only benefit those that go to Heaven is to say indirectly that those that go to Hell must not be _ungodly,_ since Christ died for all of the ungodly. But of course, those that are thrown into the lake of fire are _ungodly_ (Rev. 21:8; 1 Cor. 6:9,10; etc.). Therefore, Charles Spurgeon's Calvinism is also clearly wrong about the infinite work of Christ.


## VIII. Charles Spurgeon presumptuously states that he holds _more firmly_ to Calvinism, which is also known by some as the _doctrines of grace,_ than anyone else:

> There is **no soul living** who holds more firmly to **the [doctrines of grace](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/perseverance-of-the-saints.htm)** than I do .... (p. 176).

COMMENT: It is sheer presumption for Charles Spurgeon to make such a comment, for there might have been someone somewhere, that Charles Spurgeon didn't know about, who did hold more firmly to Calvinism than he did.

Moreover, since Calvinism is equated with _grace,_ but is incorrect according to the Scriptures, then Charles Spurgeon and **Calvinism must be a [**false grace**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/true-grace-false-grace.html) message**. This is especially evident as the Calvinists, and other OSAS proponents, would say [**David**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html), while in adultery and murder, remained saved all along. Jude warned of those that would turn _grace_ into a license for immorality. Christians are commanded to **_contend_** against this perversion of _grace:_

> Dear friends, although I was very eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I felt I had to write and urge you to contend for the faith that was once for all entrusted to the saints. For certain men whose condemnation was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are godless men, who **change the grace of our God into a license for immorality** and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord (Jude 3,4, NIV).


## IX. Charles Spurgeon believed a _heresy_ preacher, like the Arminian John Wesley, could have been an _apostle,_ if more were needed!

> Most atrocious things have been spoken about the character and spiritual condition of John Wesley, the modern prince of Arminians. I can only say concerning him that, while **I detest many of the doctrines that he preached**, yet for the man himself I have a reverence second to no Wesleyan; and **if there were wanted two apostles to be added to the number of the twelve, I do not believe that there could be found two men more fit to be so added than George Whitfield and [John Wesley](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wesley.htm)** (p. 176).

COMMENT: **How could a _heresy_ preacher be the Lord's apostle?** In other words, according to Charles Spurgeon, since Arminianism is a _heresy_ and John Wesley was the _modern prince of Arminians,_ how then could Wesley qualify for the office of apostle? Remember, among other things, apostles teach doctrine and doctrine **must** be _sound:_

> You **must teach** what is in accord with **sound doctrine** (Titus 2:1, NIV).

Again, Charles Spurgeon reveals that he was an irrational thinker as he describes Wesley, as a prime candidate for "apostle"!


## Charles Spurgeon's _Defense of Calvinism_Has Been _Tested_ and It FAILED MISERABLY

After comparing Charles Spurgeon's _Defense Of Calvinism_ to the Scriptures, I've found his personal beliefs and arguments for such not only weak, but much worse than that. **Charles Spurgeon's teachings are clear contradictions to the Holy Scriptures.** Moreover, he flatly contradicted John Calvin, yet all the while claimed to be a strong Calvinist. Charles Spurgeon also showed himself to be presumptuous and at another time totally illogical by what he wrote about Wesley. **With all of this in mind, Charles Spurgeon had an overall darkened and confused view of the Scriptures, as do others that embrace Calvinism. Charles Spurgeon, therefore, can NOT be justly branded _the prince of preachers_ like some unwittingly call him, even though he had a large following in his day and is often favorably quoted in our day.**

Finally, and most importantly, Charles Spurgeon's _gospel of Calvinism_ and _doctrines of grace_ are NOT the message of the Scriptures. If Charles Spurgeon truly knew the Scriptures, he could NOT have written such a _Defense of Calvinism,_ as he did. It would have been IMPOSSIBLE. In fact, if Charles Spurgeon really understood the Scriptures he would have been forced to openly renounce and refute Calvinism, as other Christians have. In light of all of this information, no informed Christian should ever quote this staunch Calvinist in a way as to give the impression that he was profoundly informed about the Scriptures. To do so is to actually act in a counterproductive way to the spreading of basic, sound, Christian doctrine, which Charles Spurgeon clearly opposed by believing in and trying to defend Calvinism.

## Charles Spurgeon's Example As A Cigar Smoker

> While Mr. Spurgeon was living at Nightingale Lane, Clapham, an excursion was one day organised by one of the young men's classes at the Tabernacle. The brake with the excursionists was to call for the President on their way to mid-Surrey.
