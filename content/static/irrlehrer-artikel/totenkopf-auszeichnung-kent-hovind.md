![Kent Hovind](../../files/pictures/KentHovind.jpg)

Dr. Kent Hovind is the founder of _Creation Science Evangelism._ He needs to be congratulated for his sound teaching refuting the prevalent theory of _evolution_ and for teaching _creationism_. However, along with his teachings refuting evolution, Kent Hovind dangerously slips in the license for immorality and [**<u>doctrine of demons</u>**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/doctrine-of-demons.html) commonly known as [**<u>_once saved always saved_</u>**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html). This is what Kent Hovind also teaches as he refuted evolution:

> Anyway, the Lord said “Come into the Ark.” And so all the critters went in—two of each kind and seven of some. And then **the Lord shut the door. That’s a good eternal security verse by the way**. When God shuts the door, it won’t leak. People say, “**Brother Hovind, do you believe you’re eternally secure?” Yep. I got born into God’s family and he is stuck with me.** Now some of God’s children, he takes them home and crowns them. Other children, he ‘crowns’ them and takes them home. But **if you are saved, you are eternally secure, you are going to heaven**. (_Creation Seminar,_ Part 6 video, The Hovind Theory).

Did you notice that Kent Hovind, in different words, is suggesting that God will kill an unrepentant sinning person, who was previously _born again_ and take him home to heaven? That is a horrible distortion of God’s word and his version of the [**_sin unto death_**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sinuntodeath.html). Kent Hovind said:

## Kent Hovind To A Christian Friend

All of that should be crystal clear that **Kent Hovind believes in _once saved always saved_,** even though it is NOT Biblical, but here is another quote from a personal letter from Kent Hovind to a dear Christian ministry friend who sent it to us. Kent Hovind wrote:

> **I CANNOT lose my salvation and go to hell. I CAN however lose my reward of entrance into the 1,000 yr kingdom!** (All capital emphasis his)

Many Scriptures refute Kent Hovind, but here is a clear one:

> The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; **the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.** Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time **we will reap a harvest IF we do not give up.** (Gal 6:8,9)

**That is clearly a SALVATION passage and not a REWARDS passage as the words _eternal life_ prove. The Gal. 6:8,9 salvation passage is never quoted by the prominent teachers of our day for various reasons, even though it is vital for Christians to understand after getting born again.**
Furthermore Kent Hovind makes the mistake that he can have salvation but _not inherit the kingdom of God!_ That is clearly refuted in the teaching, **_[Will Not Inherit The Kingdom Of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/will-not-inherit-the-kingdom-of-God.htm)_**. Kent Hovind is rightly awarded the infamous _Skull and Crossbones Award_ for his deadly teaching of **[eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html). People need to be warned that part of Kent Hovind's _creation teaching_ is a snare to SOULS, as it obliterates the holy [_image of a Christian_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/image-of-a-christian.htm)_ and sets one up for a spiritual fall (1 Cor. 10:12).** God bless you.
