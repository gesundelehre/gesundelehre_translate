## Got Questions (S. Michael Houdmann) Ist KEINE Gesunde Quelle

![S. Michael Houdmann von Got Questions lehrt eine Lizenz für Unmoral](../../files/pictures/snc_de.jpg)

**S. Michael Houdmann, der Antwort-Mann hinter _Got Questions_, lehrt eine Lizenz für Unmoral. Obwohl es richtig sein mag, dass S. Michael Houdmann tausende von Antworten auf diverse Fragen geliefert hat, heisst das nicht, dass seine Antworten immer biblisch gesund und geistlich wohltuend/gesund sind, speziell im Bezug auf verschiedene _Heils/Errettungs_-bezogene Themen. Ich versichere dir, aus der Perspektive der Bibel sind sie es nicht!** (Viele Kulte, inlusive der [**Zeugen Jehovas**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html), Church of Christ, etc. können auch _Fragen beantworten_, aber geben auch oft eine falsche Antwort!)

![s. michael houdmann](../../files/pictures/s-michael-houdmann.jpg)

In brief, _Got Questions_ is a very influential and answer-giving _[**once saved always saved**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)_ group, which has undoubtedly misinformed thousands of precious souls seeking God’s truth. Got Questions misleading answers regarding _salvation_ issues are spiritual **_poison_** sprinkled throughout its ministry.

[Besides proclaiming/defending _once saved always saved_, Got Questions also denies _repentance_ to be _turning from sins_ (_“What is repentance and is it necessary for salvation?”_)_,_ the exact opposite of what Jesus taught it to be! NOTE: Jesus said the Ninevites _**repented**_ at the preaching of Jonah (Mt. 12:41) and Jonah 3:10 shows the Ninvites _turned from their sins_. Hence, _turning from sin_ is what Jesus said _repentance_ is! End of discussion. **S. Michael Houdmann is therefore wrong about how to come to initial salvation (get _born again_)! He deserves the _Skull and Crossbones Award_  just for that, but there is more.]**

<big><big>**[QUESTIONS For _Got Questions_](#got%20questions)**</big></big>


## Confusion and Contradictions Reign

![got questions](../../files/pictures/got-questions.jpg)

_Got Questions_ is filled with doctrinal confusion and contradictions when dealing with the _believer’s security and his salvation,_ but not other issues such as opposing [_**infant baptism**_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/infantbaptism.htm) or defending the _[**deity of Christ**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/God-in-the-flesh.htm)!_ For him, _salvation_ must be different and therefore a _smoke and mirrors_ technique must be employed through his various double messages!

For example, one indirect contradiction is his view that a _carnal_ Christian cannot act the same as unbelievers in _**continuous**_ sin, **but then he recommends [Charles Ryrie's](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ryrie.htm) (and [Charles Stanley's](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-stanley.html)) books, which teach _carnal Christians do act the same as unbelievers!_** Here’s the proof. While writing on _easy believism,_ S. Michael Houdmann wrote:

> **Those who continue to walk according to the flesh are not believers.** This is why Paul exhorts us to “examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith” (2 Corinthians 13:5). The “carnal” Christian who examines himself will soon see that he/she is not in the faith.... **Is it possible that the new person Christ creates is one who continues to walk in the carnality of the flesh? It is not.**

Danach ist die _empfohlene Quelle_ die er zitiert _So Great Salvation_ von Charles Ryrie. Beachte, was Ryrie schrieb:

> Paulus kann nur meinen, dass diese fleischlichen Christen wie nicht gerettete Menschen lebten. Dies verdeutlicht, warum **das Wort fleischlich beides einen Ungläubige und Gläubige bezeichnen kann, einfach da die Lebensweise von beiden dieselbe ist.**  (1989, ed, S. 62).

Hence, we have both confusion and a clear contradiction! So now I got a question for Got Questions: Which is wrong—S. Michael Houdmann as he teaches on _easy believism_ **or** S. Michael Houdmann as he recommends Ryrie’s teachings?

NOTE: Got Questions also repeatedly misuses 2 Cor. 13:5\. When Paul told that church group to _examine_ themselves it was over _doctrine_, **not their _behavior:_**

> Prüfet euch selbst, ob ihr im Glauben seid; stellet euch selbst auf die Probe! **Oder erkennet ihr euch selbst nicht, daß Jesus Christus in euch ist**? Es müßte denn sein, daß ihr nicht echt wäret! (2.Kor 13,5; Schlachterbibel 1951)

● S. Michael Houdmann also contradicts himself when he writes on Romans 7:14-25, a typical favorite of the _grace-changing_, _security in sin_ teachers. Regarding that passage, S. Michael Houdmann says:

> ... **Paul uses to describe himself.** How can the greatest of the Apostles **characterize himself, and by extension, all Christians**, as **“unspiritual,”** a **“slave to sin”** and **a “prisoner of the law of sin”**?

As with other once saved always saved proponents, who teach **salvation can co-exist with adultery, murder, theft, lying, witchcraft, etc.,** _Got Questions_ also teaches that the Romans 7 passage is referring to **_Christians!_** If it is as he says, and it really refers to normal Christian living (and Paul as a Christian), then _all Christians continuously keep on doing evil acts as a slave to sin._ Let me focus your attention especially on verse 19, which reads:

> Denn nicht das Gute thue ich, das ich will, sondern **das Böse**, das ich nicht will, **übe ich aus**. (Röm 7,19; Schlachter 1905)

The Greek tense is clear. **It is a CONTINUOUS tense _do evil!_** Again, **if** Romans 7:14-25 is the Christian life, then Paul and other Christians **_continuously do evil!_** That is a _demonic_ distortion of the real [**image of a Christian**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/image-of-a-christian.htm). It is impossible to have _salvation_ and act like that, according to Scripture:

> Und daran erkennen wir, dass wir ihn erkannt haben, **wenn wir seine Gebote halten. Wer sagt: Ich habe ihn erkannt, und hält seine Gebote nicht, der ist ein Lügner und in diesem ist die Wahrheit nicht.** (1.Joh 2,3-4; Zürcher 1860)

> und [so] zur Vollendung gelangt, ist er allen, die ihm **gehorchen**, der Urheber ewigen Heils geworden, (Heb 5,9; Schlachterbibel 1951)

See also Romans 6. The eternal security teachers have dangerously mangled the saintly Christian image into a hollow and powerless [**form of godliness**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/form-of-godliness.html). **The truth is, Romans 7:14-25 is _not_ the Christian life at all.** Verse 18 is clear in stating it is the _sinful nature_ which is referred to, and therefore **_not_** a Christian:

> Denn ich weiß, daß in **mir, das ist in meinem Fleische**, nichts Gutes wohnt; das Wollen ist zwar bei mir vorhanden, aber **das Vollbringen** des Guten **gelingt mir nicht**! (Röm 7,18; Schlachterbibel 1951)

S. Michael Houdmann also wrote:

> Yes, Christians **should** turn from sin. Yes, Christians **should** commit their lives to obeying God (quoted from, _What are the steps to salvation?_)

But how is that possible? Remember, he just taught Rom. 7:14-25 refers to Paul as a Christian, who couldn’t even do that, according to that passage! So, how could any Christian?

See [**_The Believer’s Conditional Security_**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dan-corner-the-believers-conditional-security.html) pages 206-212 for much clear proof that Rom. 7:14-25 is **_not_** Paul or the normal Christian life. Don’t be deceived by the grace changers.


## S. Michael Houdmann’s _Sin Unto Death_

● Besides saying indirectly that Christians **_do evil continuously_ by teaching Rom. 7:19 is the _Christian_ life**, S. Michael Houdmann also teaches a license to sin under his distorted version of the [_**sin unto death**_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sinuntodeath.html). Note the clarity of what he wrote:

> The “sin unto death” is **deliberate, willful, continuous, unrepentant sin**. God, in His grace, allows **His children**  to sin without immediately punishing them. However, there comes a point when God will no longer allow **a believer to continue in unrepentant sin**.  When this point is reached, God sometimes decides to punish **a Christian**, even to the point of taking his or her life.

**_Got Questions_ again presents a _dangerous_ false image of a Christian as a _deliberate, willful, continuous, unrepentant_ EVIL doer!** Contrast that to God’s truth:

> Ihr Kindlein! **Niemand verführe euch!** Wer die Gerechtigkeit thut, der ist gerecht, gleichwie Er gerecht ist. **Wer die Sünde thut, der ist aus dem Teufel;** ... (1.Joh 3,7-8; Zürcher 1860)

We can _obey_ God. We do not have to sin continuously. **The truth is, S. Michael Houdmann (because of embracing _once saved always saved)_ is presenting a person who is _of the devil,_ as being a _Christian!_** How dangerous is that? How _heretical_ is that?

Folks, **a real Christian is _following Jesus_ now and putting God’s word into _practice_ (John 10:27; Lk. 8:21; etc.). The security in sin teachers want us to think the exact opposite of God’s truth as they teach about the _sin unto death_, Rom. 7:14-25, David, etc.!** That has to be the voice of the devil speaking through them as they repeat the essence of the devil’s first lie to mankind, _you will not surely die_ and thereby deny [**spiritual death**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html) as a possibility for the righteous. It isn’t just S. Michael Houdmann, but all [**eternal security teachers**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html)!

As cited earlier, S. Michael Houdmann has a double message about salvation. Such is all through S. Michael Houdmann’s poisoned answers on this subject. His inconsistencies are a sure sign of falsehood.

Remember what Houdmann said about the _sin unto death_ and how certain _**Christians** continue in unrepentant sin_:

> The “sin unto death” is **deliberate, willful, continuous, unrepentant sin**.

His readers must be thoroughly confused, especially if they ever read his answer to: _Will God continue to forgive you if you commit the same sin over and over again?_ Note, what S. Michael Houdmann wrote there!

> ...it must be noted that it is **not biblical for a person to sin habitually and continually as a lifestyle and still be a believer.**

So, which is right? Can a Christian (a believer) sin habitually and continually? Yes or no? **_Yes_, if you go by his _sin unto death_ answer**, but no if you go by _some_ of his other writings!

Dear reader, if you were in math class and the teacher taught 2+2=4, then at another time taught 2+2 =7, it would lead to mass confusion and an inability for the students to learn _truth._ It would also indicate the teacher’s inability to teach math and hold such an office. As serious as that may be, this is much more serious than simple math. This will stretch into E-T-E-R-N-I-T-Y.

Numerous examples could be cited to show how contradictory Got Questions is, but the following one makes the point well. It comes from his answer on _How bad can a Christian sin_:

> **Is a person who lives a life of <u>continual sin a believer? No.</u>** When we become Christians, our lives will change. **Anyone who is <u>living a sinful lifestyle</u> and claims to be a Christian** is either lying, is self-deceived, or **<u>really is a believer</u> who is going to experience God’s judgment and discipline.**

Confused by that? You should be! He is consistently _inconsistent_ when dealing with salvation. Of course, S. Michael Houdmann would have to believe it is possible for a Christian to sin _continually_, because of his doctrine. It is basic that all license for immorality teachers like him think David remained saved while in adultery and murder! That implies there are _Christian adulterers_ and _Christian murderers_, in contrast to Rev. 21:8 and 1 Cor. 6:9,10.

![got questions](../../files/pictures/got-questions.jpg)


## <a name="got%20questions"></a>I Got Questions For _GotQuestions_

(1) Why don’t you just **_consistently_**  tell everyone you believe a Christian can commit adultery, murder, disown Jesus, steal, lie, swindle, practice witchcraft, etc. and safely remain on the road to heaven, since he was once saved?

(2) Do you realize the _salvation_ doctrine you embrace and teach to others is an attempt to _mock God_ by indirectly saying one can sow to please his flesh and still reap _eternal life?_

> **Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked.** A man reaps what he sows. **The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction;** the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap **eternal life**. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest **if we do not give up**. (Gal 6:7-9)

(3) Are you willing to turn away from teaching such doctrinal _poison_ for your own soul’s sake and for the good of your readers?


## S. Michael Houdmann vs Dan Corner _Eternal Security_ Debate, Which Never Occurred

S. Michael Houdmann was contacted to debate me on eternal security and he flatly declined as almost all others like him have. His response (excuse) was:

> Yes, I am fairly familiar with the EO [[**Evangelical**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/index.html) Outreach] site. I find your material on Catholicism, Mormons, JWs, Sabbatarians, baptismal regeneration, etc., to be quite good and helpful.
> 
> **I have to respectfully decline your invitation to debate**. Again, if Dan Corner approaches this issue from the perspective that **eternal security is a lie from the pit of hell, straight from the lips of the devil, and that anyone who teaches eternal security is an unsaved false teacher** - I do not see how we could possibly have a productive and respectful dialogue.
> 
> Dan Corner has engaged in countless debates on this issue, similar to what you are proposing here. Have any of them resulted in anyone's mind being changed? This issue has been hotly debated for 400 years. Dan Corner and I debating will not solve the disagreement or end the debate.
> 
> Sincerely in Christ,
> S. Michael Houdmann

While it is certainly true that I do view the doctrine of once saved always saved (which is the same as eternal security or the [**perseverance of the saints**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/perseverance-of-the-saints.htm)) as a _lie from the pit of hell_ and the eternal security teachers as unsaved teachers **(since I am in full agreement with Jude and 2 Peter 2, among other reasons)**, that is not a solid reason not to debate. Doesn’t S. Michael Houdmann likewise believe the same about me and my doctrine on salvation?

NOTE: S. Michael Houdmann views all **_NO Eternal Security_** Christians who reject once saved always saved asmaintainingour own _salvation by our own good works and efforts_. Below is what he wrote in, _Is eternal security a “license" to sin?”_

> **Any denial of eternal security is, in its essence, a belief that we must maintain our own salvation by our own good works and efforts.** This is completely **antithetical to salvation by grace.**

Doesn’t that imply that all **_NO Eternal Security_** Christians are _unsaved_ and teaching _antithetical to grace,_ from his dark perspective? _Yes,_ it does! So why is he so concerned about what we have stated concerning people like him? He believes the same way about us, since one can’t have salvation apart from God’s _grace._

S. Michael Houdmann is also guilty of misrepresenting people like us. **We don’t teach antithetical to Biblical _grace_ at all.** The following is what we believe at Evangelical Outreach and it is entirely Biblical:

> **We believe that we are saved by grace (Eph. 2:8,9) but we can fall from grace (Gal. 5:2-4).** We are justified by faith (Rom. 5:1) but our faith can become shipwrecked (1 Tim. 1:19,20) and cease to exist (Lk. 8:13; Rom. 11:19-23). We are not under the law (Rom. 6:14,15) but if you live according to the sinful nature you will die (Rom. 8:13). Paul taught against legalism (Gal. 5:3,4) but he also taught that no immoral, impure or greedy person has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God (Eph. 5:5-7). We are not saved by works (Eph. 2:8,9) but to reap eternal life and not destruction you must sow to please the Spirit and not the sinful nature (Gal. 6:8,9). God is faithful to us (1 Jn. 1:9; 1 Cor. 10:13) but we must be faithful to him to the very end of our lives to escape the lake of fire or second death (Rev. 2:10,11). God surely loves us (Jn. 3:16; Mk. 10:21; Rom. 8:35-39) but those who inherit the kingdom of God love God (Jam 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:9) and to love God means to obey his commands (Jn. 14:15; 1 Jn. 5:3). We have freedom in Christ (Gal. 5:1) but this freedom is not to indulge the sinful nature (Gal. 5:13; 1 Pet 2:16).

**_Once saved always saved_ is a _dangerous_ snare to precious souls.** The sooner Christians recognize it and fight against it the better it will be for all concerned. Compromise with such dangerous teachers is [**spiritual treason**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-treason.htm).


## Final Nails in the Coffin Of _Got Questions_

S. Michael Houdmann teaches a severely confused _double message_ regarding salvation, but his beliefs are often well camouflaged with his verbiage and double talk. He wants it both ways and, therefore, terribly contradicts himself to his own harm and the harm and confusion of his readers. These are undeniable facts, as the aforementioned proves, and that also reflects his false teachings regarding _salvation._ Simple logic declares **no one can teach contradictions without error.**

It is impossible to teach true Biblical holiness and obedience as an expression of saving faith in the Lord Jesus, if one believes in the _damnable heresy_ and [**doctrine of demons**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/doctrine-of-demons.html) called _eternal security_. Why? Because the latter denies and contradicts the former especially when backsliding occurs. [**Eternal security**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) **allows for unrepentant wickedness and salvation simultaneously. As hard as S. Michael Houdmann tried to deny and hide that fact, his doctrine is a license for immorality!**

I have nothing personal against S. Michael Houdmann, but he deserves our _Skull And Crossbones Award._ It is his [**false _grace_**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/true-grace-false-grace.html) and _demonic_ doctrine which repulses me and needs to be combated. S. Michael Houdmann, I remain willing to debate you on **_eternal security._**
