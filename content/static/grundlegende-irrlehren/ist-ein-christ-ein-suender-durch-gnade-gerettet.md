## According To Scripture - Is a Christian a Sinner Saved by Grace?

[![sinner saved by grace](../../files/pictures/is-a-christian-a-sinner.jpg "Is a Christian a sinner saved by grace? NO!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/nonerighteous.html)

**We have received many emails over the years from people who think a Christian is a _sinner saved by grace._ Hence they are implying that _all Christians are sinners_ or that they _must continue to sin all the time in this life_!** This teaching is written for the express purpose of shedding Biblical light on this subject. The reader is asked to drop all preconceived ideas about being a sinner saved by grace and ponder the various times the words _sinner_ and _sinners_ are found in the Bible. Cited in this article is **every verse that contains these words in the New Testament**. After this list, several important observations will be made as a consequence:

## Was Paul a _Sinner Saved By Grace_ or _Saint Saved By Grace_?

Just listed was every verse in the New Testament where the words _sinner_ or _sinners_, are found with only the following exception:

> It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save **sinners**, among whom I am foremost _of all_. (1 Tim 1:15)

The Apostle Paul identified himself as a _sinner_ there but the context reveals **he was talking about his life _before_ he came to salvation**. Notice the context of that Scripture:

> I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, putting me into service, even though **I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor**. Yet I was shown mercy because **I acted ignorantly in unbelief**; and the grace of our Lord was more than abundant, with the faith and love which are _found_ in Christ Jesus. It is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save **sinners**, among whom **I am foremost _of all_**. Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost, Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience as an example for those who would believe in Him for eternal life (1 Tim. 1:12-16).

**When Paul wrote _I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent aggressor_ it clearly shows he is writing about the time when he was unsaved. This is further shown when he also wrote _I acted ignorantly in unbelief_**. How sad it is that false teachers will remove 1 Tim. 1:15 from its context in an attempt to pin the label of _sinner_ on Paul after his salvation! (See our other materials also answering their similar misrepresentation of him at [**Worst Of Sinners**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/worst-of-sinners.htm).) **What a horrible distortion of God's holy word it is to to call Paul or any Christian a _sinner saved by grace!_ This is what the [eternal security teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html), especially, have done. It is nothing for them to slander the holy character of Paul in this way, or mishandle any other Scripture, as long as they can somehow portray the Christian life as allowing for wickedness, fruitlessness, worldliness and the like. The [eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) teachers have a dangerously darkened understanding of what God's word teaches and have corrupted multitudes by their teachings.**


## _Sinner Saved By Grace_ - Repent!

Regarding the words _sinner_ (or _sinners_) the truth is if you are such, then **Jesus has called you to _repent_ (turn from wickedness)**:

> I have not come to call the righteous but **sinners to repentance**. (Luke 5:32)

It is crystal clear that God's word contrasts _sinners_ with _righteous_ people numerous times. In other words, if you are a _sinner_, then you are not _righteous_ and therefore not in line for God's _kingdom_, but instead headed for _the furnace of fire_, where there will be _weeping and gnashing of teeth_:

> These will go away into eternal punishment, but the **righteous into eternal life**. (Mat 25:46)
> 
> So it will be at the end of the age; the angels will come forth and take out the **wicked** from among the righteous, and will throw them **into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth**. (Mat 13:49,50)
> 
> The Son of Man will send forth His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all stumbling blocks, and those who commit lawlessness, and will throw them into the furnace of fire; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Then THE **RIGHTEOUS** WILL SHINE FORTH AS THE SUN in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. (Mat 13:41-43)


## Are you _of the Devil_

Furthermore, the one who does what is sinful is **_of the devil_**. Such a person is not considered righteous merely because of a past moment of **[faith in Jesus Christ](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/believing.html)** as some have been deceived into believing:

> Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. He who does what is sinful is of the devil .... (1 John 3:7,8)

Finally, Paul wrote of himself:

> I have the same hope in God as these men, that there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. So I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man. (Acts 24:15,16)

Dear reader, Paul always maintained a clear conscience before God and man in light of a resurrection of both the righteous and wicked (or _sinner_). **He clearly put himself with the group that is described in Acts 24:15,16 as _righteous_. Therefore, in light of this Scripture and the aforementioned ones, neither was the Apostle Paul nor is any Christian a _sinner_, even though the people who change _grace into a license for immorality_ (like the type mentioned in the [book of Jude](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/Jude.htm) -- verses 3,4) would like you to think otherwise. By that type of misrepresentation of the Christian as a _sinner_, false teachers have tainted the holy [image of Christianity](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/image-of-a-christian.htm) itself. Again, a Christian is NOT a _sinner saved by grace_ even though he was a sinner before salvation and is saved by grace!**
