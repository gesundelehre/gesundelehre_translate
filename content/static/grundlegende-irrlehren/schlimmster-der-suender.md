## Paulus, Als Ein Christ, War NICHT Der _Schlimmste der Sünder_

**Ob du es glaubst oder nicht, die Theologie einiger has labeled the Apostle Paulus als den _schlimmsten der Sünder!_ Schockierend, aber wahr! Dieses _Schlimmster der Sünder_ label wurde manchmal auch schon mit Römer 7,14-20 verbunden:**

[![schlimmster der sünder](../../files/pictures/paul-was-a-false-apostle-worst-of-sinners-lie.jpg "Paul was NOT the worst of sinners as a Christian!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-life.html)

> We know that the law is spiritual; but **I am unspiritual, sold as a slave to sin.** I do not understand what I do. For what I want to do I do not do, but what I hate I do. And if I do what I do not want to do, I agree that the law is good. As it is, it is no longer I myself who do it, but it is sin living in me. **I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature.** For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out. For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, **the evil I do not want to do -- this I keep on doing.** Now if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I who do it, but it is sin living in me that does it (NIV).

## [Hier Ist Der Beweis Dafür, Dass Der _Schlimmste Der Sünder_ Vers Falsch Angewandt Wurde](#worst%20of%20sinners)

## Könnte _Unaufhörlich BÖSES Tun_ Das Normale Christliche Leben Sein?

Some have erroneously alluded to that Roman's passage by saying it's _normal Christian living_ and the like:

> Paulus spricht von von [sic] dem normalen christlichen Leben. ([**Robert Morey**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/morey.html))

> Die Erfahrung die in Römer 7,14-25 beschrieben wird, ist die eines jeden echten Christen. (Arthur Pink)

Misapplying this Roman's passage to Paul, Gromacki and [**John MacArthur**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/John-MacArthur.html) respectively wrote:

> Paulus sagte, dass er "unter Sünde verkauft" war (Röm7,14). **Sünde besass und kontrollierte ihn; er war dessen Sklave.**

> Romans 7 is the classic text describing the believer's struggle with his sinful flesh. Note that while **Paul acknowledged his own disobedience** ....

**Remember this, we should always compare Scripture with Scripture when studying the [Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html).**

[![schlimmster der sünder](../../files/pictures/man-in-hell-because-of-eternal-security.jpg "Church-goer in hell who thought if Paul was the worst of sinners he could be sinful and a Christian too because of eternal security.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternaltorment.html)

**If this is done, it will become apparent that Paul didn't _keep on doing_ (Rom. 7:19) sinful things, as he frequently taught against; neither was he _unspiritual_ (v. 14).** Let's journey around the New Testament to learn more about Rom. 7:14-20.

## War Paulus ein Heuchler, Als _Schlimmster von Allen Sündern_, Oder _Heilig?_

Bitte beachte was Paulus über sich selbst schrieb in seinem ersten Brief an die Korinther:

> He [Timothy] will remind you of **my way of life in Christ Jesus, which agrees with what I teach everywhere in every church** (1 Cor. 4:17, NIV).

Paul's _way of life_ (or behavior) agreed with what he taught all the churches. So what did Paul teach Christians about behavior? Among other things, he taught:

> But among you there must **not be even a hint of sexual immorality,** or of **any kind of impurity, or of greed,** because these are improper for God's holy people. **Nor should there be obscenity, foolish talk or coarse joking,** which are out of place, **but rather thanksgiving** (Eph. 5:3,4, NIV).

> Put to death, therefore, whatever belongs to your earthly nature: **sexual immorality, impurity, lust, evil desires and greed,** which is idolatry. Because of these, the wrath of God is coming. You used to walk in these ways, in the life you once lived. **But now you must rid yourselves of all such things as these: anger, rage, malice, slander, and filthy language from your lips. Do not lie to each other, since you have taken off your old self with its practices** (Col. 3:5-9, NIV).

> It is God's will that you should be sanctified: that you should **avoid sexual immorality;** that each of you should **learn to control his own body in a way that is holy and honorable,** not in passionate lust like the heathen, who do not know God; and that in this matter no one should wrong his brother or take advantage of him. The Lord will punish men for all such sins, as we have already told you and warned you. **For God did not call us to be impure, but to live a holy life. Therefore, he who rejects this instruction does not reject man but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit** (1 Thess. 4:3-8, NIV).

Paul's personal behavior conformed to these passages, according to 1 Cor. 4:17\. What else did Paul say about his own behavior?

> **Whatever you** have learned or received or **heard from me, or seen in me -- put it into practice. And the God of peace will be with you** (Phil. 4:9, NIV).

Ponder that statement! If the Philippian Christians would put _into practice_ what they had _heard_ and _seen_ in Paul as exemplary, the God of peace would be with them. **Could Paul have been that kind of example if he was _controlled_ by [**sin**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html)**. Lightner wrote:

> Paul, for example, **often did what he didn't want to do** (Rom. 7:15).

In contrast, Paul declared explicitly how he and his co-laborers behaved:

> You are witnesses, and so is God, of how **holy, righteous and blameless we were among you who believed** (1 Thess. 2:10, NIV).

What a refutation Paul's actual life was to the [**Once Saved Always Saved**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) interpretation of Rom. 7:14-20.

The Scriptures add to all of this by saying that Paul:

- never used flattery nor put on a mask to cover up greed (1 Thess. 2:5);

- put no stumbling block in anyone's path (2 Cor. 6:3);

- was pure, patient, kind, had sincere love, truthful speech, etc. (2 Cor. 6:6,7);

- hatte nur ein Ziel und das war Gott zu gefallen (2. Kor. 5,9);

- fürchtete Gott (2. Kor. 5,11);

- riskierte sein Leben für den Namen des Herrn Jesus (Apg 15,26);

- fulfilled his duty to God in all good conscience (Acts 23:1);

- ran his race to win first prize (1 Cor. 9:24);

- did not seek his own good but the good of others for their salvation's sake (1 Cor. 10:24,32); etc.

In another concise summary of his own life, Paul said that he conducted himself in the _holiness and sincerity_ that are from God:

> Now this is our boast: Our conscience testifies that **we have conducted ourselves** in the world, and especially in our relations with you, in the **holiness and sincerity** that are from God. We have done so not according to worldly wisdom but **according to God's grace** (2 Cor. 1:12, NIV).

Is it possible for Paul's words, _I am unspiritual sold as a slave to sin_ (Rom. 7:14), to refer to himself in light of all of these passages about his own behavior? Never!

Besides Paul's holy and zealous lifestyle, we know the OSAS interpretation of Rom. 7:14-20 is wrong in yet another way! Let's focus our attention in upon verses 18 and 19:

> ... For I have the desire to do what is good, **but I cannot carry it out.** For what I do is not the good I want to do; no, **the evil I do not want to do -- this I keep on doing** (Rom. 7:18,19, NIV).

In other words, the spiritual power is missing to live a holy life [**free from sin's bondage**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/slave.htm), according to those verses. Is it possible that Paul is speaking of himself or _the normal Christian life_ by writing such? If so, then how did Paul live such a consistently holy life?

Paul elaborates on the Christian's [**freedom from sin**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html):

> **And having been set free from sin,** you became slaves of righteousness (Rom. 6:18, NKJV).

Before salvation, however, a person is _powerless:_

> You see, at just the right time, when we were still **powerless,** Christ died for the ungodly (Rom. 5:6, NIV).

An unsaved person is without spiritual power, being under the control of his [**sinful nature**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sinful-nature.htm) (Rom. 7:5) and the evil one (1 Jn. 5:19), but after [**salvation**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html), one is freed from the power of Satan (Acts 26:18) and sin (Rom. 6:18; Jn. 8:36) to live a holy life (2 Tim. 1:9).

Furthermore, if we focus our attention in upon Rom. 7:18, we clearly see that Paul wrote in that passage that _nothing good lives in me._ Could Paul have written that from his own [**Christian**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html) perspective?

**Isn't it true that God lives in all Christians (2 Cor. 6:16) and God is _good_ (Mk. 10:18)? Since that is true, and Paul was a Christian when he wrote his epistles, then it is impossible for Paul to have written _nothing good lives in me_ from the perspective of a Christian!**

What then was Paul referring to when he used the singular pronouns _I_ and _me_ in Rom. 7:14-20?

**Rom. 7:17 clearly shows the _sinful nature_ is the _I_ and _me_ that Paul wrote of:**

> I know that nothing good lives in **me, that is, in my sinful nature.** For I have the desire to do what is good, but I cannot carry it out (Rom. 7:18 NIV).

**In other words, the _sinful nature_ is personified in Rom. 7:14-20 just like _wisdom_ is in Proverbs 8!** So, Paul was not writing of himself or _the normal Christian life,_ but of the _sinful nature_ in this much-disputed passage.

## Worst of Sinners Verse

**The context of Paul referring to himself as the _worst of sinners_ refers back before he became a Christian when he was _once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man_. It is NOT Paul as Christian, as we have already seen:**

> Even though I was once a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man, I was shown **[mercy](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mercy.htm)** because I acted in ignorance and unbelief. The grace of our Lord was poured out on me abundantly, along with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. Here is a trustworthy saying that deserves full acceptance: Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners--of whom I am the worst. But for that very reason I was shown mercy so that in me, **the worst of sinners,** Christ Jesus might display his unlimited patience as an example for those who would believe on him and receive eternal life. (1 Tim 1:13-16)

Finally, how could Paul have stated, "I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith" (2 Tim. 4:7) at the very end of his life, if he was owned and controlled by sin as the _worst of sinners?_ Since the Christian battle, in part, is against sin (Heb. 12:4), Paul fought this fight against sin also in his own life and came out as an **[overcomer](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/he-who-overcomes.html). He was not the _worst sinner of all time_ as he has been slandered by some!**

## [The _Image Of A Christian_ Has Been Smeared](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/image-of-a-christian.htm)

## Christ's Slave or _Worst of Sinners_

The Christian is _free,_ but at the same time, he is **_Christ's slave_** (1 Cor. 7:22) and a _[**slave to righteousness**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/slave.htm)_ (Rom. 6:18)! As freed people, we are to be living for Jesus and his cause (2 Cor. 5:15). In fact, service to God is an immediate responsibility after turning from our idols that kept us in spiritual darkness and [**death**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html) (1 Thess. 1:9 cf. Jonah 2:8).

With these verses in mind, how could the real freedom in Christ message, coupled with the [**true grace**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/true-grace-false-grace.html) message, added to the proper interpretation of Romans 7, dismiss lukewarm, unholy, worldly, entertainment-seeking, amusement-seeking, pleasure-seeking "servants" who have very little or no fear of God as _normal?_ **To misapply the _worst of sinners_ label to Paul as a Christian, is to do much damage to the _Christian image_ and what it means to be a [believer in Jesus](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/believing.html).**
