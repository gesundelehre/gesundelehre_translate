## The Teaching of Eternal Security is _Another Gospel_

[![eternal security another gospel](../files/pictures/eternal-security-another-gospel.jpg)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.htm)

_**Another gospel**_ **is a false gospel, that is, a wrong gospel of grace -- one which is not based on the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ and his apostles as found in the Bible.** To preach _another gospel_ is to be under a divine _[**anathema**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anathema.htm)_ (Gal. 1:8,9). The ramification of that is _condemnation for the false teachers._ Hence, declaring _another gospel_ is one of the **most lethal preaching and teaching errors anyone could ever make!** 

So, how does _another gospel_ relate to teaching the doctrine of eternal security (or _once saved always saved_)? To answer that we must consider _how important is the teaching of eternal security to the [**eternal security teachers**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.htm)?_ In other words, is this topic of primary importance to them or merely a "non-essential"? The following quotes from various _[**once saved always saved**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.htm)_ teachers will answer that question for us. This is what they have gone on record as saying regarding the importance of the doctrine of _eternal security_ and which shows it is _another gospel:_


## They Present It As The "Gospel"

![John Ankerberg](../../files/false_teachers/john_ankerberg.jpg) 
> Eternal security is one of those outstanding glories of the Christian **gospel**(**[John Ankerberg](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ankerber.htm)**). 

![Charles Stanley](../../files/false_teachers/charles_stanley.jpg)
> The very **gospel** itself comes under attack when the eternal security of the believer is questioned (**[Charles Stanley](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/stanlysc.htm)**). 

> One must believe in the perseverance of the saints if one is to accurately present **the gospel of grace**. To do anything else is to edit the **gospel** (**[James White](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jimwhite.htm)**). 

![Charles Spurgeon](../../files/false_teachers/charles_spurgeon.jpg)
> Calvinism is the **gospel** and nothing else (Charles **[Spurgeon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spurgeon.htm)**).


## They Present It As Being Related To The "Atonement"

![Robert Morey](../../files/false_teachers/robert_morey.jpg) 
> The eternal security of the believer arises out of the necessity and nature of the **atonement** (**[Robert Morey](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/morey.htm)**).


## They Present It As "Grace"

![Charles Ryrie](../../files/false_teachers/charles_ryrie.jpg)
> What **grace** it is that can give us not only forgiveness and eternal life through faith alone but also guarantee that the Giver will never renege on His gift! Nor can we give it back even if we try! (**[Charles Ryrie](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/ryrie.htm)**). 

> Once a son, always a son. Once you are born into the family of God, you will always be a member of the family of God. You cannot change your spiritual birth anymore than you can change your physical birth ... the moment you believed in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, you were born into the family of God. At that point, you became a child of God, and for all eternity you will remain a child of God. **This is the grace of God**. There is nothing you can do to alter it (Robert Thieme, Jr.). 

**[Calvinism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.htm)** is supposed to be "the doctrines of **grace**."


## They Present It As "Foundational to Christianity"

> ... the very **foundations of Christianity** begin to crumble once we begin tampering with the eternal security of the believer (Charles Stanley).


## They Have Taught "Heretics" Oppose The Perseverance of The Saints

> The carnal mind is unable to comprehend this doctrine of the perseverance of the saints .... the **heretics** oppose it (Synod of Dort, Article 15).


## _Another Gospel_ Is A FALSE Gospel

Now that we know how this doctrine has been exalted to the zenith in importance by various eternal security teachers themselves by linking it to **the gospel**, the **atonement, grace**, and **foundational to Christianity**, with **heretics** opposing it, let's now examine how they have presented their _gospel,_ really _another gospel,_ to convince some people that it is Scriptural.


## A Partial Truth Taught As The Whole Truth Has Resulted In _Another Gospel_

1\. They teach we are saved by grace not by works (Eph. 2:5-9), but they stop there! They never teach that Christians can _fall_ from the _grace_ that saves to the point where Christ is of _no value_ : 
> Mark my words! I, Paul, tell you that if you let yourselves be circumcised, **Christ will be of no value to you at all**. Again I declare to every man who lets himself be circumcised that he is obligated to obey the whole law. You who are trying to be justified by law have been alienated from Christ; **you have fallen away from grace** (Gal. 5:2-4). 

Comment: Since a **[Christian](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.htm)** can _fall_ from the grace by which he is saved, **then he would no longer be with the salvation he once had because of grace**. Furthermore, for a Christian to fall from grace to the point where Christ is of _**no value** at all_, can only mean **no more salvation!** 


2\. Eternal security teachers declare **we are justified by faith (Rom. 5:1), but they stop there**! They never proclaim the additional truth that a true believer can cease believing and _fall away_ (or [**die spiritually**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.htm)): 
> Those on the rock are the ones who receive the word with joy when they hear it, but they have no root. **They believe for a while**, but in the time of testing they **fall away** (Lk. 8:13). 

Comment: **A true believer can cease believing**, according to the Lord Jesus! Such would make him an _unbeliever_. Question: what did God Himself declare about the _unbelieving_? He taught: 
> But the cowardly, the **unbelieving**, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice **[magic arts](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/occult.htm)**, the idolaters and all liars - **their place will be in the fiery lake of burning sulfur**. This is the second death (Rev. 21:8). 

Moreover, 1 Pet. 1:9 adds important truth to this by stating: 
> you are receiving the goal of your **faith**, the salvation of your souls. 

Notice: The _goal_ of our faith is _**the salvation of our souls**_. Hence, **if our faith gets destroyed, then there can be no salvation for our souls in the end.** 

Finally, Paul believed a Christian could have his faith _shipwrecked_ and told Timothy what he needed to do to prevent this from happening to him: 
> holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and so have **shipwrecked their faith**. Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme (1 Tim. 1:19,20). 

**Note: Paul knew that Timothy's saving faith could become _shipwrecked_, as Hymenaeus and Alexander's faith did, and told him what to do to prevent this from happening to himself.** The implications of that are: (a) A Christian has free will and human responsibilities under Biblical _grace_ that can affect his salvation. (b) A Christian cannot just throw off all holy restraints and be negligent. For him to think that since he has been _sealed_ by the Holy Spirit he is eternally secure or that God will continue to hold on to him, even if he turns away, is fallacious! 


3\. OSAS teachers declare **[eternal life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternallife.htm) is a _gift_** (Rom. 6:23) and **a present tense possession** (Jn. 6:47; 1 Jn. 5:12,13), but they stop there! The following supplementing Scriptures are not presented by them, which distorts the truth: 
> That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs according to the **hope** of eternal life (Titus 3:7). 

> The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit **will reap eternal life**. Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest **if we do not give up** (Gal 6:8,9). 

> But he shall receive an hundredfold now in this time, houses, and brethren, and sisters, and mothers, and children, and lands, with persecutions; and **in the world to come eternal life** (Mk. 10:30). 

> To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, **he will give eternal life** (Rom. 2:7). 

Jesus and His Apostles taught that eternal life is a _hope_, yet to be _reaped_, in _the world to come_, but only _if we do not give up_ sowing to please the Spirit and _persist_ in doing good! 

Note: To get eternal life, **we must _persist_ in doing good** (Rom. 2:7). This parallels how the Lord described those who would, in the end, enter the Kingdom of God: 
> Those **who have done good** will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned (Jn. 5:29). 


4\. Frequently, the eternal security teachers will misuse Jude 24 by stating a partial truth about it as the whole truth: 
> Now unto him that is able to **keep** you from falling, and to present _you_ faultless before the presence of his glory with exceeding joy (Jude 24). 

They conclude that it is God who _keeps_ us from _falling_, but they fail to mention that saved people still _fall_ and even _fall away_! See Mt. 11:6; 26:31,33; Lk. 8:13; Heb. 6:6; 2 Pet. 1:10; 3:17; etc.


## Under _Grace_ Christians Are To _Keep_ Themselves

> Be dressed ready for service and **keep** your lamps burning (Lk. 12:35). The man who loves his life will lose it, while the man who hates his life in this world will **keep** it for eternal life (Jn. 12:25). 

> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to **keep** oneself from being polluted by the world (Jam. 1:27). 

> **Keep** yourselves in God's love as you wait for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ to bring you to eternal life (Jude 21). 

> Dear children, **keep** yourselves from idols (1 Jn. 5:21). 

> ... do not share in the sins of others. **Keep** yourself pure (1 Tim. 5:22). 


5\. Eternal security teachers (another gospel teachers) sometimes refer to certain religious people as _[**never really being saved to begin with**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm)_, based on Mt. 7:23: 
> Then I will tell them plainly, "I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!" 

But additional truth from Mt. 25:1-12 reveals that five out of ten virgins from the last generation will have their lamps stop burning before the Lord returns. They will hear the Lord say something different to them: 
> "I tell you the truth, **I don't know you**" (Mt. 25:12). 

Comment: The Lord Jesus did not say to those five foolish virgins, "I _never_ knew you," but instead stated that He did not know those virgins any longer **at that time,** with the words, _**I don't know you.**_ 

**As just proven, eternal security teachers declare _another gospel_ and partial truths about _salvation_ as the whole truth as they deceive their listeners by doing so. Vital related facts are not mentioned, but rather avoided or distorted, which changes the conclusion from [eternal security to a conditional security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.htm). Friend, eternal security is _another gospel_**. Remember: 

- A Christian can fall from _grace_ to the point where Christ is of _**no value** _to him. 
- A saving faith in Christ can become _shipwrecked_. Also a true believer can cease believing and become an unbeliever. 
- Eternal life is a _hope_, yet to be _reaped, in the age to come,_ but only for the ones who _sow to please the Spirit, persist in doing good_ and _don't give up._ 
- Under **_grace_**, Christians are commanded to _keep_ themselves. 
- A person once _known_ by God can later become unknown!


## Another Gospel Built on Misused Scriptures

By taking Scripture out of context the eternal security teachers have also deceived their listeners. For example, the wonderful promise of [**John 10:28,29**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john1028.htm) can only be properly understood in its context, which goes back to v. 27: 
> My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and **they follow me**: And I give unto them eternal life; and **they shall never perish, neither shall any _man_ pluck them out of my hand**. My Father, which gave _them_ me, is greater than all; and **no _man_ is able to pluck _them_ out of my Father's hand** (Jn. 10:27-29).

Some people see salvation with "no strings attached," that is, regardless how far one may stray doctrinally or sinfully, he will always be of the group that shall _**[never perish](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john1028.htm)**_. The context of Jn. 10:27-29 destroys this deadly interpretation of the most commonly cited proof text for eternal security. Verse 27 describes the sheep and states they **_follow_** Jesus. The Greek word is a **continuous tense** and describes the only people that will _never perish_ and won't get _plucked_ out of God's hand (vv. 28,29). 

<u>**Hence: eternal security (or once saved always saved) is _another gospel_ and counterfeit grace message built upon partial truths presented as the whole truth and distorted Scriptures, as just proven.**</u> **More truth on the subject of salvation reveals that the Bible teaches a conditional security for the believer. For example, the Lord Jesus taught those already saved:** 
> And ye shall be hated of all _men_ for my name's sake: but **he that endureth to the end shall be saved** (Mt. 10:22). 

Note: Jesus spoke those words to His disciples as they were being sent out to preach and heal. The context is **not** the Jews during the tribulation period, as some eternal security teachers usually say! Moreover, Jesus was **not** joking when He taught Christians they would have to endure **to the end for salvation's sake!** 

Furthermore, the Lord taught Christians, after his infinite work on the cross: 
> Do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer. I tell you, the **[devil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.htm)** will put some of you in prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. **Be faithful, even to the point of death**, and I will give you the **[crown of life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/crown.htm)**. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. **[He who overcomes](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/he-who-overcomes.htm)** will not be hurt at all by **the second death** (Rev. 2:10,11). 

Comment: Jesus mentioned faithfulness, but **not** God's faithfulness to us as stressed by the OSAS teachers, but **our faithfulness to God _even to the point of death_**. Such a person is promised something to receive and not receive. He will receive the crown of life and won't be hurt by the "second death" (another name for _the lake of fire_, according to Rev. 21:8).


## The Real Gospel vs Another Gospel

> We have come to share in Christ **if we hold firmly till the end the confidence we had at first** (Heb. 3:14). 

Paul, the real grace teacher, also wrote: 
> By this gospel you are saved, **if you hold firmly** to the word I preached to you. **Otherwise, you have believed in vain** (1 Cor. 15:2). 

> But now he has reconciled you by Christ's physical body through death to present you holy in his sight, without blemish and free from accusation - **if you continue in your faith**, established and firm, not moved from the hope held out in the gospel. This is the gospel that you heard and that has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven, and of which I, Paul, have become a servant (Col. 1:22,23). 

1 Cor. 15:2 and Col. 1:22,23 declare the true gospel of grace and reveals that it has a **conditional security for the believer** attached to it! That was the original message, as taught by the Lord Himself and His Apostles. **Do not be deceived by the eternal security false gospel and counterfeit grace message, which is built upon partial truths and Scripture removed from its context. [**Eternal security is a doctrine of demons**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/doctrine-of-demons.htm), _another gospel_ and nothing better! So **[is eternal security Biblical](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.htm)**? NEVER! [**Christians can quickly turn to another gospel**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/galatians.htm)** (a false gospel of grace).**

It is the most exhaustive and comprehensive refutation to the devil's teaching of eternal security (once saved always saved or the [perseverance of the saints](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/perseverance-of-the-saints.htm)) that has ever been written!
