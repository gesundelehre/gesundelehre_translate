## The Most Feared Questions Are About _Unforgivable Sin_

**There are four questions related to _eternal sin, blasphemy of the Holy Spirit and unforgivable sins in the bible_.  They are: (1) What is _unforgivable sin?_(2) What is _blasphemy of the Holy Spirit?_ (3) Is there hope for a _backslider?_ (4) Can a person who loses his salvation ever get _saved again?_**

[![](../files/pictures/unforgivable-sin.jpg "unforgivable sin")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans6.html)

Those are some _of the most feared questions one can ponder._ **Many have been misled** about them to the point that they have, **_in terror,_** contacted us to learn if they could ever be forgiven for their many sins as a [**backslider**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/backslider.html) or are they hopelessly doomed to go to hell! So, is [**_Twice Lost Always Lost_**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/twicelost.htm) , true or false? Folks, the best place to begin for these answers is Mark 3:22-30:

> And the teachers of the law who came down from Jerusalem said, **“He is possessed by Beelzebub! By the prince of demons he is driving out demons.”** So Jesus called them and spoke to them in parables: “How can Satan drive out Satan? If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand. And if Satan opposes himself and is divided, he cannot stand; his end has come. In fact, no one can enter a strong man's house and carry off his possessions unless he first ties up the strong man. Then he can rob his house. I tell you the truth, all the sins and blasphemies of men will be forgiven them. But **whoever <u>blasphemes against the Holy Spirit</u> will never be forgiven; he is guilty of an <u>eternal sin</u>.” He said this because they were saying, “He has an evil spirit.”**

## Unforgivable Sin In The Bible Revealed

In those verses, Jesus’ enemies committed _eternal sin_ (or _blasphemy against the Holy Spirit)_ when they believed and said **_Jesus had a demon and by the power of the devil he drove out demons_.**That solves the mystery. That is what _eternal sin_ (or _blasphemy of the Holy Spirit)_ is. In spite of all the sinful people Jesus came into contact with, **the only ones Jesus ever said who committed _unforgivable sin_ were the ones saying _Jesus had an evil spirit and by the power of the prince of demons he is driving out demons._** Remember that. That is crucial information and the answer to **_what is unforgivable sin_**.

**NOTE: Eternal sin has _nothing_ to do with sexual immorality, murder, homosexuality, [drunkenness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/drunk.html) , theft, swindling, greed, lying,[witchcraft](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/occult.html), etc** _Eternal sin_ deals **_only_** with the _blasphemy_ of saying Jesus had an evil spirit and by the power of the devil he was driving out demons. **Hence, unless you have believed and said such, you have not committed _eternal sin._ It is impossible.**

**So there is hope for the _backslider_. The backslider can return in _sincere repentance_ to God and get _saved again._** The ultimate proof of this is also from the Lord Jesus, when he taught about the _prodigal_. That younger son departed into **_wild living_ with the prostitutes.** After an **undesignated time period** he realized his folly and **turned from all of that wickedness to return to the Father to serve him.** The Father _ran_ to meet him and _kissed_ him. Then we are given Luke 15:24, which says:

> For this son of mine was dead and is **alive again;** he **was lost** and is found. So they began to celebrate.

**In other words, the Prodigal did NOT commit _eternal sin._ He was able to get forgiven and saved again even after _deliberate_ wicked living which brought about his [spiritually _dead_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)and _lost_ condition.** (NOTE: The prodigal lost his salvation before he repented.) God had mercy on him **_because he sincerely repented and desired to serve God._** He is a prime example of a backslider, who God was _happy_ to forgive and have back in his presence again.



_Sincere repentant backslider,_ ponder those truths and **stop allowing the devil to fill your mind with his torturous _lies_ designed to destroy you! It isn’t God who is telling you, you can not get forgiven of sexual sin, drunkenness, murder, etc. It is the _father of lies_, the [devil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html).**

Besides that clear [**Prodigal Son**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/prodigal-son.html) teaching we have **Peter, who lost his salvation by _disowning_ Jesus** (Mt. 10:33). **He also _fell away_ at that point, according to Mt. 26:31.** Afterwards, Peter repented and got saved again too. He _turned back to the Lord or got converted_ when he **repented** (Luke 22:32). **Hence, neither sexual immorality with prostitutes or disowning Jesus is beyond forgiveness, with these examples!** Other Scriptures show [**King David got forgiven of adultery and murder and saved again**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html), and Manasseh came to first time salvation after a whole host of some of the _vilest_ acts, according to 2 Chron. 33.

## The Unforgivable Sin Against the Holy Spirit From Hebrews 6:4-6 and 10:26-29

**Certainly some are wondering about [Heb. 6:4-6 and Heb. 10:26-29](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hebrews.htm).** In both passages we read of those who **_deliberately_ committed unforgivable sin,** so they could return to the synagogues, according to the _history_ of that time period. **They could not come to repentance again, unlike the prodigal, Peter, David, the unnamed in [James 5:19,20](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/james51920.html); and many others. Furthermore, do not confuse the sin unto death with the unpardonable sin! Also, the [sin unto death vs. the unpardonable sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sinuntodeath.html) issue is non-existent, based on scripture.**

In summary: _Blasphemy of the Holy Spirit_ or _eternal sin_ is **only**  committed when a person **_believes Jesus had a demon and by the power of the devil he performed his miracles._ Also, remember, eternal sin (though unforgivable) is NOT the only sin that will drag one to hell. There are various ways to go to hell and _most people_ will be there in the end.**

Folks, remember forgiveness and freedom from sin’s addictions are **_only_** found in the Lord Jesus. When you come to first time [**salvation**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html) you will become a [**new creation in Christ**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/new-creation.html). **Do not be deceived: All who _do evil_ will be thrown into the fiery furnace:**

> Des Menschen Sohn wird seine Engel aus-senden, und sie werden aus seinem Reiche sammeln **alle Aergernisse und die da Unrecht thun, und werden sie in den Feuerofen werfen**; daselbst wird das Heulen und das Zähneknirschen sein. (Mt 13,41-42; Schlachter 1905)

Turn from your sins and place a **_submissive_** faith in the Lord Jesus for salvation. Follow him unashamedly. **No person or sin is worth going to hell over.** The real salvation issue is this: **Are you following Jesus NOW? The question, _have you ever been born again_ is not the key question for present tense salvation and implies a belief in [once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html). Again, the issue is, where are you at this _present time?_ Hopefully, these Bible truths about _unforgivable sin, eternal sin and blasphemy of the Holy Spirit_ have helped you.**
