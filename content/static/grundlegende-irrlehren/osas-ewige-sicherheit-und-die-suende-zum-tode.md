## The _Sin Unto Death_ Verse

**The bogus _sin unto death_ understanding given by the eternal security teachers reveals their license to sin!**

[![sin unto death](../../files/pictures/sin-unto-death-eternal-security.jpg "The OSAS version of the sin unto death is DEMONIC!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/etlicense.html) 

**It is important to know about because you will probably never hear any eternal security teacher say outrightly their doctrine is a _license for immorality_. In fact, they will most often flatly deny this charge sometimes to the point of yelling _slander_.** However, there are still various ways these people teach this very thing they hate to be identified with. Again, this is through their twisted version of the _sin unto death_. The apostle John wrote of this sin:

> If anyone sees his brother commit a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray and God will give him life. I refer to those whose sin does not lead to death. There is **a sin that leads to death**. I am not saying that he should pray about that. All wrongdoing is sin, and there is sin that does not lead to death. (1 John 5:16,17).

<big>**[Can A Real Christian Experience Spiritual Death (Sin Unto Death) After Initial Salvation](#sinuntodeath)**</big>

Clearly, there is _sin unto death_. Whatever type of _death_ this is, is not clearly identified in 1 John 5:16,17\. However, the eternal security teachers like to draw our attention to 1 Cor. 11:27-30 to teach physical death is the sin unto death:

> Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of sinning against the body and blood of the Lord. A man ought to examine himself before he eats of the bread and drinks of the cup. For anyone who eats and drinks without recognizing the body of the Lord eats and drinks **judgment on himself**. That is why many among you are weak and sick, and **a number of you have fallen asleep.**

And to that they further try to connect the sin unto death to the physical deaths of Ananias and Sapphira. To them, they are specific examples of the _sin unto death:_

> Then Peter said, "Ananias, how is it that Satan has so filled your heart that you have **lied to the Holy Spirit** and have kept for yourself some of the money you received for the land? Didn't it belong to you before it was sold? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? What made you think of doing such a thing? You have not lied to men but to God." **When Ananias heard this, he fell down and died**. And great fear seized all who heard what had happened. Then the young men came forward, wrapped up his body, and carried him out and buried him. About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. Peter asked her, "Tell me, is this the price you and Ananias got for the land?" "Yes," she said, "that is the price." Peter said to her, "How could you agree to test the Spirit of the Lord? Look! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out also." At that moment **she fell down at his feet and died**. Then the young men came in and, finding her dead, carried her out and buried her beside her husband (Acts 5:3-10).



## To Them The _Sin Unto Death_ Is Always Physical

**To the eternal security teachers _sin unto death 1 John 5_ will always be physical death,** such as mentioned in 1 Cor. 11:30 and Acts 5:3-10\. **While it is undeniable truth that God gets so angry over sin that he kills people because of it,** there is another truth related to the sin unto death that the eternal security teachers will always deny - that **sin can bring a Christian to his [spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html). Hence, just like Adam and Eve who _died spiritually_ because of their sin, as God warned (Gen. 2:17), Christians can experience the same. God didn't kill them physically, but they did _die_ spiritually. For them it was a _sin unto death_ in a _spiritual_ sense!**

From the eternal security perspective, when a person once saved dies physically, he goes to heaven. How such people are living at that point is inconsequential, **even if God would kill them physically because of their <font color="red">**unrepentant _heinous_ sins.**</font> This clearly spells out a _license for immorality_ and that is their poisonous understanding of the _sin unto death._**

## Dave Hunt's _License For Immorality_

Please note what Dave Hunt teaches about this as he comments on the 1 Cor. 11 passage and the _sin unto death:_

> For this cause, some of you are weak and sickly and some of you sleep; some of you died because **God has brought judgment upon you for the way you have conducted yourselves and so forth**. So I think what he's saying is, there are **<font color="red">some sins that are so heinous</font>** and **not only heinous** but perhaps I think it depends upon the position that a person has that **brings reproach upon Christ and God takes them home** for that. [Radio show 0121\. (The word, heinous, is defined as "utterly reprehensible or evil.")]


## Sin Unto Death - Judgment or Blessing?

**To be consistent with [Dave Hunt ministries](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/carnal-christian-dave-hunt.htm) _license for immorality_ or his _security-in-sin gospel_, commonly called [eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) (once saved always saved, the [perseverance of the saints](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/perseverance-of-the-saints.htm) or the preservation of the saints), Dave Hunt must always teach the way just cited**. Question for [**Dave Hunt**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/davehuntsc.html) (and all other eternal security proponents):

> **What kind of punishment is this that God would kill a person because of their unrepentant _heinous sins_ and take them out of this cursed environment filled with sin, injustice and pain to a beautiful paradise where joy, peace, truth, righteousness, etc. will be?**

For Paul, to live was Christ and die was _gain_ and _better by far_ (Phil. 1:21-23), but **these "blind guides" want us to think we can live for self, sin and the devil and die in those sins and still go to heaven. Hence, death isn't really a punishment at all, but a _blessing_ and _gain_ for their hatred of God and wickedness.**

**To look at this in another way, one can therefore backslide into _heinous_ sin and wickedness, absolutely refuse to repent even though disciplined and get blessed by the thrice holy God for his unyielding stubborn rebellion when God strikes him dead in his holy wrath and anger AND TAKES HIM TO HEAVEN! Dear reader, that is nonsense! If you ponder the horrible conclusion produced by the eternal security teachers, you will have to agree that their version of the _sin unto death_ is nothing more than a deadly, religious myth yielding an opportunity to live in _wild_ rebellion to God - _a license for immorality._**

## D. James Kennedy's _Sin Unto Death_

The so-called _Berean_ Dave Hunt is not alone with these Scriptural fabrications and distortions about the _sin unto death_. <font color="magenta">**Dave Hunt has the staunch Calvinists as his close companions and co-laborers on the _sin unto death,_ even though he claims to oppose Calvinism!**</font> Please note what Calvinist, D. James Kennedy has likewise written about the _sin unto death:_

> I think back many years ago of **a man in this church who was engaged in adultery** - a man who had been a minster [sic] and had left the ministry, but a man who seemed to be a godly man - a man who seemed to be a Christian. Only God knows the heart. He **became involved with a married woman**. He was going to have her divorce her husband and marry him. I admonished him and urged him to repent. He was brought before the discipline committee and they admonished him to repent. He was suspended from the sacraments, but **he did not repent.** Finally, the Session determined that since **he remained impenitent,** they would have to excommunicate this man from the church. Just before that happened, God pulled his string and **suddenly that young man died.** These are just some of the unlimited, infinite ways God can chasten **those who are truly His own**, who do not repent of their sins. My friends, we need to take the warnings seriously because they are very real. [D. James Kennedy, Can A Christian Fall From Grace? (Ft. Lauderdale FL: Coral Ridge Ministries), pp. 14, 15.]

**So Dave Hunt and the Calvinists are identical twins regarding the _sin unto death_, because they both teach eternal security**, that is, **once a person becomes saved he will always remain saved regardless how far into wickedness he may go and remain there without any repentance!**

## Calvinism's Christian _Adulterers_

D. James Kennedy's message comes through loud and clear regarding his so-called [**_doctrines of grace_**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html). **He is indirectly saying by his story that Christian adulterers do exist**. In contrast to this deadly doctrinal myth, the Bible speaks of only one type of adulterer and he is always shown as one who will not inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:9,10), but instead will be thrown into the lake of fire (Rev. 21:8), unless he repents. **But the eternal security teachers don't think this person has to repent for salvation. He will still get to heaven and escape hell in his unrepentant _adultery_ or _heinous_ sins, because he was once saved!** How God must hate this deadly lie which has multitudes deceived.

At times D. James Kennedy's Calvinism will have him declare **the elect will endure in holiness to the end**, but then he turns right around and blatantly teaches his _sin unto death_ yarn. Doesn't D. James Kennedy know that dying in adultery is not _enduring to the end in holiness?_ Clearly, this is a **[doctrine of demons](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/doctrine-of-demons.html)**, which Christians must oppose!


## God Lovers and God Haters

Dear eternal security reader, don't let yourself be deceived by popular teachers of our hour and from yesteryear who have changed grace into _a license for immorality,_ as just proven. This should be apparent now after considering what both types of eternal security teachers have said about the _sin unto death_. **Their deadly version of grace with the _sin unto death_ allows or permits all forms of unrepentant wickedness for those that get regenerated**. In contrast, the Bible says the following:

> However, as it is written: "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared **for those who love him**" (1 Cor 2:9).
> 
> Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and to **inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him**? (James 2:5)

In other words, **those who actually enter God's kingdom _love_ God.** (This is the real issue, not if God loves them.) **To love God we must _obey_ him** (John 14:15,21,23,24; 1 John 5:3). Moreover, not to love Jesus is to be unsaved:

> If anyone does not love the Lord, **he is to be accursed**. Maranatha. (1 Cor 16:22)

Clearly, one is not _loving_ God if he is in such sins as those just taught under the _sin unto death_ by the well-known Dave Hunt and D. James Kennedy. Jesus taught:

> **He who does not love me will not obey my teaching** .... (John 14:24)

Furthermore, Hebrews 10 say:

> If we deliberately keep on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, no sacrifice for sins is left, but only a fearful expectation of judgment and of **raging fire that will consume the ENEMIES OF GOD.** Anyone who rejected the law of Moses died without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much more severely do you think a man deserves to be punished who has trampled the Son of God under foot, who has **treated as an unholy thing the blood of the covenant that sanctified him**, and who has insulted the Spirit of grace? (Heb 10:26-29)

**Did you notice that one becomes ([spiritually dead](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html) and) an _enemy of God_ by turning to that type of _willful sin_ (unforgivable sin)**, the very thing that Dave Hunt's and D. James Kennedy's teachings allow for **without jeopardizing salvation, with their false _sin unto death._** Also, Heb. 10:27 says _the fury of fire_ (or raging fire) will consume God's enemies. How much more clear can it get? The ones killed by God because of their deliberate sinning go to the fires of Hell, not heaven.

Also, the true Christian is clearly called by the term _saint,_ which means _holy one_. **Since sin can make a holy person unholy again** (1 Tim. 5:22; Rev. 3:4; etc.), and therefore unfit for entrance into the kingdom of God (Mt. 5:8; Heb. 12:14; Rom. 6:22; etc.), then **these [eternal security teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html) are dangerously downplaying the effects of sin in the life of a Christian. Souls are at risk because of their fables, including the _sin unto death_ myth.**

## The Real Truth About The _Sin Unto Death_

**The real truth is a true Christian can sin in such a way as to bring him back into [spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html) and endanger him to the lake of fire again (James 1:14-16; 5:19,20; Luke 15:24,32; Gal. 5:19-21; 6:8,9; Rom. 6:16; 8:13; Rev. 2:10,11; etc.). This is the real _sin unto death_, as mentioned by the Apostle John**. Moreover, if God in his holy wrath strikes someone dead because of his unrepentant adultery **he will go to hell**, not heaven, with other God haters as already shown in Hebrews. Adulterers do not inherit God's kingdom (1 Cor. 6:9,10). This was basic knowledge in first century Christianity, though popularly denied in our dark day by those who maintain their security-in-sin gospel and _license for immorality._


## Sin Unto Death Meaning

**What happened to Adam and Eve, when they sinned (and died spiritually) is a true example of the sin unto death. Similarly, the prodigal became "dead" and lost (Lk. 15:24) as a backslider in his sins. He too exemplifies the real meaning of the sin unto death. Furthermore, because the prodigal got forgiven upon repentance, his example answers the sin unto death vs. the unpardonable sin question! They are NOT the same. The sin unto death can get forgiven, while the [unpardonable sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal_sin_blasphemy_of_Holy_Spirit.html) can't.**

Sins that cause the sin unto death (or spiritual death) are the ones listed in 1 Cor. 6:9,10; Eph. 5:5-7; Rev. 21:8 and other listings which exclude one from inheriting the Kingdom of God. Lesser sins, such as worry or unthankfulness, are not sins unto death.

Dear reader, if you think you can live in heinous sin, as Dave Hunt and D. James Kennedy wants all to believe, and still be on the road to heaven, you have been dangerously deceived. You must repent (turn from sin) or you will find yourself being thrown into the lake of fire in the end. You are not just jeopardizing your physical life, rewards, etc. as they say, but **it is your very SOUL that is endangered**. Don't be deceived about the _sin unto death_ or anything else they say which allows for wickedness and salvation at the same time.

> Dear children, **do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. He who does what is sinful is of the devil** .... (1 John 3:7,8)

**Remember, if you are an [eternal security proponent](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) this information (really _sin unto death sermon_) exposes eternal security as a license to sin!**
