## Is The Never Really Saved (Never Saved) Argument Valid and Consistent


[![I NEVER KNEW YOU](../../files/pictures/magnifying_glass.png "I NEVER KNEW YOU")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)

**The _never really saved_ response comes from eternal security proponents when their doctrine is being exposed as a license to sin. For a person to say that a professing Christian was _never saved_ and always a false convert, if he turns away from God to sin, is fallacious in at least 7 different areas. If you are a Christian, carefully ponder the following so you can help others see the _dangerous folly_ of the _never saved_ declaration.**


## Never Really Saved Argument Denies We Can Tell Who Are Saved

For one to say a professing Christian who turns away from God to sin was _never saved_ is also to deny that **we can _know_ who is saved and who is not by their present tense behavior. Such is clearly _unscriptural_:**

[![never really saved never saved](../../files/pictures/never-saved-david-adultery-murder.jpg "never really saved never saved")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)

> **This is how we know who the children of God are and who the children of the devil are:** Anyone who does not do what is right **is not a child of God; nor is anyone who** does not love his brother. (1 John 3:10)

> Dear children, **do not let anyone lead you astray. He who does what is right is righteous, just as he is righteous. He who does what is sinful is of the devil.** (1 John 3:7,8)

> We know that we have come to know him **if we obey his commands. The man who says, “I know him,” but does not do what he commands is a liar, and the truth is not in him.** (1 John 2:3,4)

The Bible is crystal clear that **_we can know them by their fruit_ (Mt. 7:16,17) and there is observable _evidence_ of God’s _saving grace:_**

> News of this reached the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. When he arrived and **saw the evidence of the grace of God**, he was glad and **encouraged them all to remain true to the Lord with all their hearts.** (Acts 11:22,23)

● To say a professing Christian who turns away from God to wickedness was _never saved_ is **to deny that others were ever able to identify him as a _non-Christian_ before that happened.**


## The Never Saved Response is Inconsistent

For one to say a professing Christian who turns away from God to sin was _never saved_ is also to have **an inconsistent message.** If those same teachers were consistent **_they would have to say David, Solomon and Peter were never saved because they backslid._** David turned to **adultery and murder** (2 Sam. 11); Solomon turned to **idolatry** (1 Kings 11:4-10) and Peter **disowned Jesus** three times (Mt. 26:33,34). Both David and Peter repented and returned to God but **Solomon _continued_ in wickedness.  There is _no evidence_ that [Solomon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/solomons-apostasy.html) ever returned to God.**

**● To say a professing Christian who turns away from God to wickedness was _never saved_ is to exclude prominent Biblical characters who were truly saved _before_ terribly falling to that degree. On this basis alone, the _never saved_ argument is destroyed.**


## The Never Really Saved Belief Denies Backsliding

To say a professing Christian who turns away from God to wickedness was _never saved_ is to imply that **true Christians will not turn away to sin but _continue to obey God._ But that type of message is often opposed and scoffed at by the same teachers.** In other words, those same teachers declare Christians constantly sin in _thought, word and deed._ They also wrongly use Romans 7:14-25 for support and to teach that Paul was like that and such is the **_normal Christian life!_** Imagine that! They teach like that then turn 180 degrees around and teach the same crowd if you turn away you were **_never saved_—two completely opposite teachings, yet their audience seems oblivious to it.**

● To say a professing Christian who turns away from God to wickedness was _never saved_ is also to teach that a true Christian will **_always obey_** God and never backslide, which is denied by their misuse of Rom. 7:14-25.


## Never Saved Belief Ignores Many Scriptures

To say a professing Christian who turns away from God to wickedness was _never saved_ is to ignore at least 26 Scriptures in the NT. They show people who previously were disciples and followers of Christ later _fell away, turned away, went back,_ etc. and **_not once_ in those 2 dozen plus passages do we read because they became a [spiritual tragedy](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/tragedies.html) by [backsliding](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/backslider.html), that was evidence which proves they were _never saved._** Scripture shows it can be somewhat common for followers of Christ to turn to wickedness; get deceived into believing a false gospel; etc.

● To say a professing Christian who turns away from God to wickedness was _never saved_ is also to display ignorance of those 26 Scriptures (plus all the other relevant Scriptures) which teach the opposite. (See _The Believer’s Conditional Security,_ p. 632 for a listing of those Scriptures.)


## Implies You Can Never Know Who Is Really Saved

[![never saved to begin with](../../files/pictures/C341Pic7(72).gif "never saved to begin with")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)

**To say a professing Christian who turns away from God to wickedness was _never saved_ is also to teach you can never know if anyone is a Christian brother or sister, including _the preacher himself who taught you this never really saved absurdity. Maybe he is just a false convert too._**

**Their doctrine would have us believe another’s salvation _can’t be known_ as long as one remains alive, because as long as they remain alive they might _apostatize_ and thereby prove they were _never saved._** If you can’t tell if another is a Christian then you can’t consider someone to be _a spiritual leader_ or a _possible spouse to marry_, since both require true Christians.

● To say a professing Christian who turns away from God to wickedness was _never saved_ is also to teach that no Christian can ever know another to be a possible **_spiritual leader_** or **_spouse_ for marriage.**


## The Never Saved Argument Misuses Scripture

To say a professing Christian who turns away from God to wickedness was _never saved_ is only backed by two passages, which are both misused.


### "I Never Knew You" (Mt. 7:23)

The first is **Mt. 7:23** where Jesus tells **_continuous tense evildoers_** that he never knew them.

> Not everyone who says to me, “Lord, Lord,” will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, “Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?” Then I will tell them plainly, **“I NEVER KNEW YOU. Away from me, you evildoers!**” (Mat 7:21-23)

The context shows the religious ones referred to there were **_never saved but were continuous tense evildoers._** Those religious-but-<i>continuous evildoers</i> never had evidence of saving grace, that is, a **_freedom_ from sin addictions which occurs when one contacts the blood of Jesus at true conversion** (Rom. 6:22; John 8:34-36; Rev. 1:5; etc.), but **that doesn’t mean others who had a true conversion can’t _shrink back_, as the Bible shows has happened.**

Furthermore, the **_never saved_** proponents focus in on the one and only passage which has the words _never saved_ (or its equivalent), but conveniently overlook three passages which show others were also not known by the Lord Jesus, but not told they were _never saved_:

> But he replied, “I tell you the truth, **I don’t know you.**” (Mat 25:12)

> Once the owner of the house gets up and closes the door, you will stand outside knocking and pleading, “Sir, open the door for us.” But he will answer, **“I don’t know you** or where you come from.” (Luke 13:25)

> But he will reply, **“I don’t know you** or where you come from. Away from me, all you evildoers!” (Luke 13:27)

Jesus didn’t tell them, _I never knew you,_ like in Mt. 7:23, but instead **_I don’t know you._** That implies _they were once known (saved)_, but later lost their salvation. This is especially clear with the 10 Virgins teaching (Mt. 25:1-13).


### 1 John 2:19

The second Scripture misused by the _never saved_ OSAS crowd for support is 1 John 2:19, which **refers to people who did _not_ believe Jesus was the Christ**, as shown in 1 John 2:22:

> Who is the liar? **It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ**. Such a man is the antichrist—he denies the Father and the Son.

Their **_doctrine_** clearly excluded them from being a Christian. **They too had no evidence of saving grace since they denied Jesus was the Christ.**

● To say a professing Christian who turns away from God to wickedness was _never saved_ is also to rely chiefly upon two Scriptures, both of which are misused and misapplied. Hence, there is no solid Biblical support for it. The people referred to in each _never had evidence of saving faith because they were either continuous tense evildoers or doctrinally denied Jesus was the Christ._


## Trying To Mask a License To Sin

To say a professing Christian who turns away from God to wickedness was _never saved_ is also cited as an argument to conceal the license for immorality that the once saved always saved doctrine declares itself to be. **When their doctrine gets exposed as the _[security in sin gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html)_ or they notice gross immorality among those they have been preaching to, they then tend to mention their contradicting, inconsistent, double message with no Scriptural support—the _never saved_ absurd argument.**

With some people, it has actually succeeded in _confusing the issue_ enough to conceal the glaring wickedness and **[salvation security in sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** being taught through eternal security at other times.

● People who cite the _never saved_ argument are either grossly ignorant of hundreds of Scriptures which counter the _never saved_ doctrine or are intentionally hiding those related-but- contradictory-truths to preserve their own doctrine, which began with the devil himself in Gen. 3:4.

There are well over 100 relevant Scriptures which refute the _never saved_ argument. They only have 2 verses, which are both misused and misapplied. **_Which will you believe?_**

One more point: Calvinist **[John MacArthur](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/John-MacArthur.html)** is one of the leading proponents (along with **[Ray Comfort](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/raycomfort.html)**) of this absurd unscriptural _never saved_ (or _false convert)_ argument. Yet MacArthur clearly teaches, **at times**, there are _Christian adulterers, Christian drunks, Christian thieves, Christian liars, Christian murderers, etc._

Please consider getting our 801 page book refuting eternal security entitled, **_The Believer’s Conditional Security._** There is MUCH in it that can help you better understand this **salvation related subject.** [](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelical-books.html)[**NO Eternal Security Book**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelical-books.html)

**_The Believer’s Conditional Security_ is the most exhaustive and comprehensive refutation to eternal security ever written. [Remember the _never really saved (never saved)_ argument is not solidly based on Scripture, neither is it consistent!]**
