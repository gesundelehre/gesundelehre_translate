##Übersicht
Hier folgt eine Abhandlung darüber, weshalb der Calvinismus eine Irrlehre ist.

T.U.L.I.P. ist ein Akronym für den Calvinismus und steht für:  
**T**otal Depravity = Totale Verderbtheit (mit andern Worten die Lehre der Erbsünde)
**U**nconditional Election  = bedingungslose Erwählung
**L**imited Atonement  = limitiertes Sühneopfer (von Jesus)
**I**rresistible Grace  = unwiderstehliche Gnade
**P**erseverance of the Saints  = ?(to-do)? der Gläubigen

### Der Calvinismus ist nichts Neues
Prediger 1,9: "Was ist gewesen? Das, was sein wird! Und was hat man gemacht? Das, was man machen wird! Und es gibt nichts Neues unter der Sonne." (Schlachterbibel 1951)
Die Lehre des Calvinismus bzw. die Lehre der totalen Verderbtheit kam schon früher in die christliche Kirche hinein. Augustinus (von Hippo) trug wesentlich dazu bei, indem er manichäistisches Gedankengut in die Kirche hineinbrachte. Später in der Reformation (mit Martin Luther, Johannes Calvin, Huldrych Zwingli) lebte dieses Gedankengut dann in der reformierten/protestantischen Theologie wieder auf.  
Die [Westminster-Confession](to-do) ist DAS Calvinisten-Bekenntnis.

## What Is Calvinism Explained In Simple Terms 


## [Click To Find Out What Calvinism is Also Known As](#what%20is%20calvinism) 

**_Calvinism_ is a popular present day counterfeit theology which began with John Calvin (1509-1564). [John Calvin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/johncalvin.html) got his doctrines from Augustine of Hippo** (354-430), the same man **[Roman Catholicism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html)** exalts and claims as one of their own.

(See **[Augustine's Prayer To Mary For Salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/augustineprayer.htm)**.)

The main 5 points of Calvinism, which sets Calvinism apart, are: **T**otal Depravity, **U**nconditional Election, **L**imited Atonement, **I**rresistible Grace and **P**erseverance of the Saints. **Those points are also referred to as _TULIP - Calvinism's definition._** If **[one point of Calvinism is wrong, all five points are wrong](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hangorfall.htm)**, according to one of Calvinism's own theologians! That is how closely they are all interlinked. 

## [Click To See How Charles Spurgeon Got Smoked!](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spurgeon.html) 

**_Reformed theology_ (Calvinism) is based on man having NO free will and choice in his salvation. Salvation, according to a Calvinist, is given only to the ones God sovereignly elects to salvation. Such people (the elect) can NOT refuse that salvation. They alone are the only ones Jesus died for. (Jesus did not die for all people, according to them.)**

 [![infant damnation What is calvinism](../../files/pictures/infant-damnation-what-is-calvinism.jpg "infant damnation is part of Calvinism")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/johncalvin.html)

**The elect can NOT lose their salvation, regardless how vile they afterwards act. NO sin of omission or commission can possibly imperil that salvation.** The examples they cite for such are [**King David**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html), [**Solomon**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/solomons-apostasy.html) and Peter, which means **(according to Calvinism) a person with salvation (a Christian) can commit adultery and murder like David, turn his heart to idolatry like Solomon, and disown Jesus three times like Peter yet remain saved.**

**We can also add to that list with [John Calvin himself, who burned Michael Servetus at the stake with green wood](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/michael-servetus.html) and never repented of his murderous, cruel and non-Christian behavior! Calvinists think [John Calvin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/johncalvin.html) is in heaven now.** 

**[READ: Augustine's Prayer To Mary For His Salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/augustineprayer.htm)** 

Calvinism denies a **[righteous person will die spiritually (lose salvation) by turning to evil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)**. The last point of Calvinism commonly called _eternal security_ or _once saved always saved_ by many (or the **[Perseverance of the Saints](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/perseverance-of-the-saints.htm)** by strict Calvinists) is the most DEADLY and the most tightly embraced point of Calvinism. Some who embrace eternal security deny being even a one point Calvinist, like Dave Hunt, thereby causing unneeded confusion.

[![horrible decree calvinism refuted](../../files/pictures/horrible-decree.jpg "horrible decree calvinism refuted")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eandes.htm)

The teaching of once saved always saved (or **[Eternal Security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**) has people thinking they are irrevocably bound for heaven because of a past point of regeneration in spite of the present sins they are currently committing, even if those sins are adultery, drunkenness, theft, lying, murder, slander, idolatry, etc. Their _Reformed Tradition_ has sadly nullified the word of God (1 Cor. 6:9,10; Eph. 5:5-7; Gal. 5:19-21; Rev. 21:8; etc.)!

## Doctrines Of Grace 

[![heretic john calvin murders michael servetus](../../files/pictures/heretic-john-calvin-murders-servetus-click.jpg "heretic john calvin murders michael servetus")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/michael-servetus.html)

The _doctrines of Calvinism_ are sometimes referred to as the _**doctrines of grace** _and have made powerful inroads into the apostate church. Though popular, **all points of Calvinism are unscriptural, even if the popular cigar smoking [ Charles Spurgeon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spurgeon.html) was a Calvinist, who is called the _Prince of Preachers_ by the uninformed and because of publisher's propaganda.** Various other exalted Calvinists, past and present (like Theodore Beza, George Whitefield, John Knox, John Bunyan, William Carey, John Piper and **[John MacArthur](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/John-MacArthur.html)**) are also responsible for the spread of Calvinism, which has smeared the **[holy image of a Christian](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/image-of-a-christian.htm)** -- but camouflaged under their **[never really saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm)** argument, but lucidly revealed under their version of the **[sin unto death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sinuntodeath.html)**.

## [Testimony Of A Former 5 Point Calvinist](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/df-testimony.htm) 
## [READ: Election and Eternal Security - False Reformed Theology](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wayne.htm) 
**The truth is: man has _free will_ both before and after initial [Salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html). A saved person can be deceived, turn to evil and [die spiritually](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html). Hence, it is man's responsibility (NOT God's) under _grace_ to hold on (Rev. 3:11; 2:25; Heb. 3:6; etc.), keep our lamps burning (Lk. 12:35), continue in the faith (Col. 1:23) and endure hatred to the end to be saved (Mt. 10:22; Heb. 3:14; Rev. 2:10,11). Jesus' sheep follow him (John 10:27). Many have failed in that regard over the centuries (besides [King Solomon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/solomons-apostasy.html) and the [Apostle Judas Iscariot](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/judas.html)) and consequently got back on the road to hell again. Since a major advantage for a _backslider_ getting off the road to hell is knowing he is on the road to hell _again_, and this is flatly denied by Calvinists, then multitudes continue to perish because of that teaching!**

>One of the most disheartening aspects about Calvinism is how the proponents sometimes try to conceal what they actually believe, but readily teach the same at other times, under different circumstances. I have seen this over and over throughout the years regarding their fifth point: the perseverance of the saints.

Babies and little children are alive spiritually. All babies who die, go into the presence of God and not hell, unlike what Calvinism teaches.

[**John Calvin's Election** ](../../files/pictures/John-Calvins-Election.pdf)**(pdf)**

[**Do All Five Points of Calvinism Hang or Fall Together?**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hangorfall.htm) 
>It is very common to run into religious people who would identify themselves as four point Calvinists, three point Calvinists on down to one point Calvinists. Such people reject one or more of the five points of Calvinism's TULIP, but always seem to embrace the most deadly of the five - the perseverance of the saints (or eternal security). How logical is it for such a person who calls himself a Calvinist to be less than a five point Calvinist in light of the theology of Calvinism?

[**Eternal Security's Imputed Righteousness**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/esimputedrighteousness.html) 
>In a nutshell, the teaching of [**imputed righteousness**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/esimputedrighteousness.html) from the Reformed view point is: a person once saved is holy and righteous without living holy and righteously ([**eternal security**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)). In other words, a Christian takes on Jesus' righteousness at the point of salvation and this righteous and holy standing before God can never be changed even by the most vile and heinous evils that could afterwards be committed.

## Emails Regarding Calvinism 

(EMAIL #1) As a family, we have been attending a '_____Baptist' church in _________, Germany for the past 2+ years. My husband's parents are non-believers, but I grew up in a Penticostal church and my husband started attending church with me and gave his heart to the Lord in 2007\. Then we moved to Germany in 2008 and started looking for a suitable church. We came upon this Baptist church with an Afrikaans pastor (I am also Afrikaans, from South Africa. My husband is German) and loved them straight away. 
We had no idea what doctorine they followed as I had no idea such doctorines existed and was furthest from my mind - I was a little naive. They believed in baptising grown-ups and therefore I assumed that we believed the same thing (gospel). I had several questions and got answers regarding salvation etc., but always told my husband that the Holy Spirit warns me and that I somehow cannot fully except this teaching. I didn't really want to attend at this church, but for my husbands (penticost praise and worship and sermons were too loud in his opinion) sake went there, but never felt 'at home'. I always maintained that i will never be a Baptist and that it was too dead as they did not practice the spiritual gifts, etc. Later on it came to light that they are Calvinists. Then it started getting serious. The situation escalated to such a degree that I refused to attend church anymore (about 4 weeks now) as it feels to me like I am getting forced to decide what doctorine I will accept and that I am caught up in something I don't want to be in. 
I am now in such a debate that I don't know how to get out of it. I get accused of not wanting to know the truth, not knowing scripture, that my family (mom) doesn't know scripture well enough to help me (my mom is 71 and grew up in a God-fearing home where both parents evangelised among people of colour in SA for many years and mom worked for the Lord until this very day, playing the Organ in church, etc.), that I must make very sure that I follow the right doctorine and be careful in deciding for the Armenian doctorin and not lending my ears out to the enemy proclaiming this doctorin, that i blaspheme against Godly men like John Calvyn by saying that he was a murderer (as history states - having had people killed if they didn't accept his teaching), etc. 
It is like psychology being excersized on me and it makes me more and more uncomfortable. I have now written a letter to our pastor stating that I withdraw from church on severel grounds stated and that I want nothing to do with any doctorine, regardless Armenian or Calvanist, but only the Gospel. I am so afraid and don't know where to go and what church to attend anymore. I feel alone and utterly hurt and disappointed. It is terrible and now I understand why so many people do not want to attend a church anymore. 
Please help me in my decision. What is right and what is wrong? Are all believes based on either Armeniasm or Calvinism as they claim and if so, which one is right? Aren't these philosophies exactly what the bible warns us about? 
I hope you can help me and look forward to a positive answer in Christ Jesus. Kind regards 

([**Bible Answer**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible-answers.html)) Greetings in Jesus' name. Sorry for the distress and problems, but you are not alone! Many Christians get attacked by various dangerous false doctrines. Calvinism is only one, but it is certainly a raging issue, with the last point _once saved always saved_ being the biggest issue. 
Everything I have observed, even in the secular world, has opposite views on almost each issue (or doctrine). Hence, until you go to the Bible directly and let that message control your life and doctrinal beliefs you will be tossed back and forth. To get established you must learn the Biblical message by quality time directly in the Scriptures. 


### If One Is a Five Point Calvinist 

**If one is a 5 point Calvinist, his (false) god has predestined some to heaven and most to hell with NO CHOICE on man's part! The savior in Calvinism did NOT die for all people, but only for those who will go to heaven. The Christian in Calvinism can commit adultery and murder (like David), idolatry (like Solomon) and disown Jesus (like Peter) and not die spiritually! Hence, since these are all major serious errors, NO PERSON SHOULD BE A CALVINIST! ALL 5 points are demonic with the fifth point being the most deadly.** 

**John Calvin got his teachings from the Catholic theologian Augustine of Hippo, who wanted salvation but not without Mary. Calvin mercilessly burned Michael Servetus at the stake with green wood because of doctrinal differences (much like the Catholic church murdered non Catholics)! Calvin was a heretic, but because we are suffering under the influence of Calvinism he is exalted and described as a brilliant theologian and link from the apostle Paul to the present! Few seem to be aware of the damage he has done to multitudes and the theology he has left behind.**
 
**We believe that we are saved by grace (Eph. 2:8,9) but we can fall from grace (Gal. 5:2-4). We are justified by faith (Rom. 5:1) but our faith can become shipwrecked (1 Tim. 1:19,20) and cease to exist (Lk. 8:13; Rom. 11:19-23). We are not under the law (Rom. 6:14,15) but if you live according to the sinful nature you will die (Rom. 8:13). Paul taught against legalism (Gal. 5:3,4) but he also taught that no immoral, impure or greedy person has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God (Eph. 5:5-7). We are not saved by works (Eph. 2:8,9) but to reap eternal life and not destruction you must sow to please the Spirit and not the sinful nature (Gal. 6:8,9). God is faithful to us (1 Jn. 1:9; 1 Cor. 10:13) but we must be faithful to him to the very end of our lives to escape the lake of fire or second death (Rev. 2:10,11). God surely loves us (Jn. 3:16; Mk. 10:21; Rom. 8:35-39) but those who inherit the kingdom of God love God (Jam 2:5; 1 Cor. 2:9) and to love God means to obey his commands (Jn. 14:15; 1 Jn. 5:3). We have freedom in Christ (Gal. 5:1) but this freedom is not to indulge the sinful nature (Gal. 5:13; 1 Pet 2:16).**

___________________________________ 
(EMAIL #2) How I love your subject! Thank you very much for this insight. It just confirmed what I already believe. I have hope now and thank the Lord for people standing up for the truth like yourselves. Continue this good work in the Lord as there are many people like myself being under the attack. I believe that the message of the gospel has been made simple for all (even little children like Jesus said) to understand. God is holy and therefore we have to live holy lives and do His will. I am not a major intellectual and certainly do not want to study any man-made doctorine. I just want to read the Word and let Jesus be in control of my life and no man. Thank your for your invitation. We will certainly visit your on-line church. God bless, 

([**Bible Answer**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible-answers.html)) Thanks for the encouraging words and may God help you help people in your part of the world. SOULS continue to perish. There are many enemies of grace, even some who reject once saved always saved. Hence, even though one may claim to teach holiness and flatly reject once saved always saved, he still may be teaching a license for immorality! Ask about David when in adultery and murder. If ANY person says he was still saved after his adultery and murder, that person is spreading the DEVIL'S POISON and will hurt SOULS, and maybe even in a greater way than if he taught David remained saved and also openly embraced once saved always saved. Check this out [**Acid Test to spot a license for immorality**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/acid_test.html) 
God bless you. Heb. 3:14.

# Do All Five Points of Calvinism _Hang or Fall Together?_

## ALL Five Points of Calvinism _FALL_

**What about the _five points of Calvinism?_** It is very common to run into religious people who would identify themselves as four point Calvinists, three point Calvinists on down to one point Calvinists. Such people reject one or more of the five points of Calvinism’s TULIP, but always seem to embrace the most deadly of the five—_the **[perseverance of the saints](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/perseverance-of-the-saints.htm)**_ (or _eternal security_). How logical is it for such a person who calls himself a _Calvinist_ to be less than a five point Calvinist in light of the theology of **[Calvinism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html)**? 

[![five points of calvinism](../../files/pictures/five-points-of-calvinism.jpg "Calvinism's doctrines of grace all stand or fall together!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html)

Certainly, to the surprise of many, such is an **_inconsistency,_** according to one of their chief spokesmen, the deceased Dr. Edwin H. Palmer. Edwin H. Palmer graduated from Harvard, served in the Marines, then received both a Th.B and a Th.D in different Reformed seminaries. He was also an instructor of _Systematic Theology_ in a Reformed Seminary. Hence, Edwin H. Palmer is certainly qualified to comment on how the five points of Calvinism are interrelated, since he understood his theology so well. Edwin H. Palmer, referring to the fifth point of Calvinism, said the following: 

## [Here Is How Charles Spurgeon Feebly Tried To Defend The Five Points of Calvinism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spurgeon.html)

> **This is strictly a Reformed doctrine and hangs or falls together with the other four points** that we have been discussing. There are, however, Christians today who hold to the perseverance of the saints while at the same time rejecting the other four points. **We believe, however, and will try to show later on, that this is an inconsistency in their thinking**. (_The Five Points of Calvinism_, Moelker Printing Co. [Grand Rapids, Michigan], 1954 ed, p. 59.) 

[![five points of calvinism](../../files/pictures/infant-damnation-what-is-calvinism.jpg "HERETIC John Calvin actually taught INFANT BAPTISM and INFANT DAMNATION without scriptural backing!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvin_servetus.htm)

In keeping with his expert opinion of this theology, Edwin H. Palmer went on to write about the perseverance of the saints: 
> This doctrine also naturally **follows from the doctrine of the limited atonement** ... (ibid., p. 61). 

In other words, if the doctrine of _limited atonement_ is true, then so is the perseverance of the saints. But then on the other hand, if limited atonement is untrue, so is eternal security. **The above two quotes from Edwin H. Palmer are valuable to Christians who know all five points of Calvinism are not from God and especially desire to help free some Calvinists from the theological snare they are trapped in.** 

## [This is Why Five Point Calvinist John MacArthur is Heretical](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/johnmacarthur.htm)

Many _Calvinists,_ who are less than five pointers, correctly reject _limited atonement_ because of the Scriptural evidence which powerfully and clearly teaches that Jesus died for every person who ever lived and not just for those who will enter God's kingdom in the end. It is, therefore, _inconsistent_ for eternal security proponents to reject limited atonement and still believe in the favorite fifth point-eternal security! Again, this is not my conclusion, but the conclusion of one who knew Calvinism when he was alive, much better than the vast majority does today. 

In 1980, the year of Edwin H. Palmer's death, an enlarged edition of this same book was released. In this more recent edition the words were slightly changed from the previous quote, while retaining its essence: 
> **All five points of Calvinism hang or fall together** (_The Five Points of Calvinism_, Baker Books [Grand Rapids, Michigan], 1980 enlarged edition, p. 69). 

**Dear reader, if you know that any of the five points of Calvinism are unscriptural, then the rest are as well. All a Christian has to do, therefore, is to refute any of the five points of Calvinism and by doing so he has destroyed all five points,** according to Dr. Edwin H. Palmer himself. But dear Christian, please be assured that people who embrace Calvinism's beloved fifth point won't surrender it easily. They often feel just like Palmer did as reflected in his following statement: 

> **The teaching of "**[once saved, always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** is one of the grandest of Biblical teachings** (ibid., p. 79).

**It should be obviously that any Calvinist, including five point Calvinist Edwin H. Palmer, is wrong theologically, since they all believe in those mythical dogmas!**
