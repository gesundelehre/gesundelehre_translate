Shocking as it may sound, that overall number has been increased by the teaching of eternal security through its many deceived teen proponents.

> It amazes me how eternal security proponents can think they have found solid Scriptural support for their security-in-sin gospel when it doesn’t exist in the Bible anywhere. This, however, is exactly what they think, according to emails that we have received. Reader, be assured all of the so-called _**[verses on eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**_ have been misused somehow!

![](../files/pictures/redball.gif)[**The Plan Of Salvation**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)

> There is not a more important subject to study than salvation. In fact, there is not even a close second among all the many topics that have been taught over the centuries. Though the term salvation can be used in different ways, here it refers to deliverance from damnation in the fires of hell. This is the only way this important term will be used in this teaching.

> James was clear in stating a saving faith in Jesus will have [good] works with it (James 2:14-17). If there are no [good] works then it is not a saving faith and merely the faith of demons. Works (obedience) is the proof of a saving/living faith, but one is still saved instantly at the point of a trusting-submitting faith in Jesus, even before any good works are seen by man.

> One of the most misunderstood teachings from the Lord Jesus is this one. This passage is clear and to the point, but eternal security teachers have twisted these Scriptures and denied their clarity to preserve the heresy of once saved always saved. You are about to be stirred.

> Confessing Jesus as Lord and testifying to others about Him has always been very important - even vital (Rom. 10:9; Mt. 12:37; 10:33; etc), but for the last generation of Christians, it will be even more so, if that is possible.

![](../files/pictures/redball.gif)[**Apostasy Occurs Among Christians**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/everyNTbook.htm)

> Apostasy (departure from the faith) is a definite possibility among Christians, even though it is sometimes vehemently denied by the security-in-sin teachers, better known as eternal security or the perseverance of the saints teachers. In fact, apostasy is taught so often throughout the New Testament that it is difficult to believe that anyone sincerely desiring truth could miss it.
