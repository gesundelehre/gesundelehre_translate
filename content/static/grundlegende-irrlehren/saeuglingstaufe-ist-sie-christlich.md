## _Infant Baptism_ or _Baby Bapism_ (also called Paedobaptism) Is UNscriptural

<big><big>**[Everyone Should Know This Point About NO Infant Baptism](#infant%20baptism)**</big></big> 

![infant baptism baby baptism](../../files/pictures/infant-baptism.jpg "This is called infant baptism, but is NOT the same as Christian baptism.")

**On more than one occasion in my Christian life, I've encountered those who are part of Protestantism (Calvinists, Lutherans, Wesleyans, Episcopals, etc.) who reason just like [Roman Catholics](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html) do for _infant baptism_, though they may differ over it being the point of salvation. Though there are no Scriptures that show infant baptism (baby baptism) or a command suggesting this, such people have been very vehement at times in trying to force this _infant baptism_ interpretation out from the Scriptures.</span>** This is done in two ways:

[![infant baptism born again catholic lutheran](../../files/pictures/infant-baptism-born-again-catholic-lutheran.jpg "No one is BORN AGAIN at infant baptism")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html)

</span>

The insistence on trying to use _circumcision_ and _household_ as the basis for _**infant baptism**_ is damaging enough, but this is compounded by a total disregard for all the other many Scriptures which clearly teach **water baptism is only for _believers_ in Christ. That Bible truth makes _infant baptism_ a scriptural impossibility.**


## Infant Baptism and Circumcision

[![infant baptism baby baptism](../../files/pictures/infant-baptism-baby-baptism.jpg "Infant baptism is definitely NOT Christian baptism.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/religious-deception.html)

Those who argue for infant baptism as a Christian replacement for Old Covenant Jewish circumcision, somehow see justification for this from the following:

> **In him** you were also circumcised, in the putting off of the sinful nature, not with a circumcision done by the hands of men but with **the circumcision done by Christ,** having been buried with him in baptism and raised with him through your faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead (Col. 2:11,12).

That passage speaks of a _circumcision_, which Jesus does to a believer (that is, to his _heart_ which occurs at the point of a trusting-submitting faith in Christ). This is very similar to what we read in Romans:

> A man is not a Jew if he is only one outwardly, nor is circumcision merely outward and physical. No, a man is a Jew if he is one inwardly; and **circumcision is circumcision of the heart, by the Spirit**, not by the written code. Such a man's praise is not from men, but from God (Rom 2:28,29).

**Only _male infants_ were circumcised when Old Covenant Jewish circumcision was in effect and never females,** but that is not how such advocates regard infant baptism. So, that is another problem for them in trying to connect _circumcision_ to _infant baptism_. **But remember, based on the aformentioned verses _circumcision of the heart by the Spirit_ is the replacement of Old Covenant Jewish circumcision and not baby baptism!**

## <a name="infant%20baptism"></a>The _Believer's_ Baptism VS Infant Baptism

Jesus commissioned his disciples with the following words:

> Then Jesus came to them and said, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Therefore **go and make disciples** of all nations, **baptizing them** in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and **teaching them to [obey](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/obey.html) everything I have commanded you.** And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age" (Mat 28:18-20).

![infant baptism](../../files/pictures/infant-baptism-2.jpg "Infant baptism is very misleading.")

Jesus commanded the Eleven to: 1) Go and make disciples, 2) Baptize them [the new disciples] and 3) Teach them [the new disciples, who get baptized] to obey everything the Eleven were commanded to do, which would include this same three step command. **The proper Biblical procedure, if followed, forces us to water baptize disciples**. [Jesus' _disciple_ is a Christian (Mt. 12:47-50; Lk. 14:26,33; Acts 11:26). Moreover, one must be able to repent of his sins and place his faith in Jesus for salvation to become Christ's _disciple_ (Acts 20:21; 3:19; 26:20; Gal. 5:24; 2 Pet. 3:9; etc.).]

In order for a person to even know that he must repent and place his faith in Jesus for salvation infers that he must be beyond the _infant_ stage. Moreover, **it is only such people who can do this that qualify to be _baptized,_ according to Jesus. That clearly destroys the concept of _infant baptism_.** Again, after one becomes a _disciple_ [a Christian] he is to be water baptized and not before.

[![john calvin infant baptism calvinism](../../files/pictures/john-calvin-infant-baptism-calvinism-click.jpg "John Calvin taught infant baptism and is part of Calvinism!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html)

Notice the Mt. 28:18-20 standard being carried out even before Jesus' death:

> The Pharisees heard that **Jesus was** gaining and **baptizing** more **disciples** than John, although in fact it was not Jesus who baptized, but his disciples (John 4:1,2).

Jesus' disciples water baptized those who became Jesus' _disciples,_ that is, those who became new Christians through repentance and faith. Isn't this clear? Nowhere do we see in the Scriptures that _infants_ were ever water baptized. **_Infant baptism_ contradicts these Scriptures!**

## _Household_ NOT Infant Baptism

Certainly, one of the chief Scriptures which cites the word _household_ and is referred to by paedobaptism proponents is the following one:

> He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?" They replied, "**Believe in the Lord Jesus**, and you will be saved - you and your **household**." Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all the others in his house. At that hour of the night the jailer took them and washed their wounds; then immediately he and all his family were baptized. The jailer brought them into his house and set a meal before them; he was filled with joy because **he had come to believe in God** - he and **his whole family** (Acts 16:30-34).

The advocates of _infant baptism_ see this as Scriptural proof for their practice, but is it really that or nothing more than a **mere assumption** based on the word _household_? _Infant baptism_ people **assume the Philippian jailer must have had _infants_ in his family**, but there is absolutely no proof of this. Perhaps, his children were all grown and married or maybe he had only one child 15 years of age. We cannot be sure of any details. But this we do know, the ones that were newly water baptized came to a saving faith in Jesus Christ, **v.34,** which agrees with the Lord's standard criteria for one to receive [**Christian**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html) baptism (Mt. 28:18-20). **Therefore, it is impossible for the Philippian jailer to have had infants in his _household,_ since they can't repent and place their faith in Jesus. Acts 16:30-34 is not proof for _infant baptism._**

Notice another time _household_ is cited, which the proponents of infant baptism will probably never volunteer:

> Then the father realized that this was the exact time at which Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live." So he and **all his household believed** (John 4:53).

Clearly, everyone in that man's _household_ was old enough to have a personal faith in Jesus, which is needed for salvation. Why then couldn't it be the same way for the Philippian jailer, even apart from Acts 16:34? Moreover, couldn't the same be said about the following _household:_

> Crispus, the synagogue ruler, and **his entire household believed** in the Lord; and many of the Corinthians who heard him believed and were baptized (Acts 18:8).

The _entire household_ of Crispus was old enough to believe in the Lord. It was after this act of faith that they were water baptized. That is _household baptism_, which cannot be the same as _infant baptism._

## [Book Review Of David Bercot's, Will The Real Heretics Please Stand Up](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/david-bercot.htm)


## Cornelius and _Household Baptism_

This is the same truth conveyed elsewhere with the conversion of [**Cornelius the centurion**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/cornelius.htm) and his _household:_

> All the prophets testify about him that **everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name**. While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit came on all who heard the message. The circumcised believers who had come with Peter were astonished that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out even on the Gentiles. For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said, "Can anyone keep these people from being baptized with water? They have received the Holy Spirit just as we have." **So he ordered that they be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.** Then they asked Peter to stay with them for a few days (Acts 10:43-48).

The same ones who received forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit were the ones who heard Peter's salvation message and placed their faith in Jesus, which again, an infant cannot do. Also, Acts 10:2 states that these same new Christians feared God, which is also impossible for an infant to do. When Peter recapped what happened in Acts 10 in chapter 11, he stated that Cornelius was informed the following by the angel before he was sent for:

> He [Peter] will bring you a message through which you and all your **household** will be saved (Acts 11:14).

So, Peter would bring a verbal message (see Acts 10:43) by which Cornelius and all in his _household_ would: 1) Be saved before and without water baptism, 2) Be able to have faith in Jesus for salvation and 3) That included _[**Biblical repentance**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)_ on their part (Acts 11:18). Again, _infants_ are excluded from this usage of _household_ based on these. That is more undeniable proof that there is no _infant baptism_.


## Stephanas and Household Baptism

Next we come to the household of Stephanas, whom Paul baptized:

> Yes, I also baptized the **household** of Stephanas; beyond that, I don't remember if I baptized anyone else (1 Cor 1:16).

Later in this epistle Paul referred to these same people again:

> You know that the **household** of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and they have **devoted themselves to the service of the saints**. I urge you, brothers, to submit to such as these and to everyone who joins in the work, and labors at it (1 Cor 16:15,16).

Those included among the **household of Stephanas** _devoted themselves to the service of the saints_. Again, with Scripture supplementing Scripture, that is not something an _infant_ can do.


## Mt. 19:13-15 is NOT Infant Baptism

Another Scripture misused for infant baptism is Mt. 19:13-15:

> Then little children were brought to Jesus **for him to place his hands on them and pray for them**. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them. Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these." When **he had placed his hands on them**, he went on from there.

There is no reference here that the little children (infants) were baptized. The children were brought to Jesus for him to **place his hands on them and pray for them, which has no connection with _infant baptism._**


## The Greek Word For _Infant_

The Greek word (paidion), which can refer to an _infant_, has various meanings. Vine writes about this word:

> a diminutive of _pais_, signifies a little or young child; it is **used of an infant just born**, John 16:21; of a male child recently born, e.g., Matt. 2:8; Heb. 11:23; of a more advanced child, plural, of children, e.g., Matt. 14:21.(B)

From this word alone nothing definite can be stated about the practice of _infant_ baptism. This we do know, however, **infants are never shown to be baptized in the New Testament**, the Christian's [**final authority**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html) for all spiritual teaching (2 Tim. 3:16,17). In contrast, all believers in Christ, which often included full-grown adults, were water baptized. Even Jesus himself was baptized by [**John the Baptist**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john_the_baptist.htm) at the age of 30\. Hence, it is irrelevant what any so-called church "father" might have written, including [**Augustine of Hippo**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/augustineprayer.htm), Irenaeus or Origen, about getting _born again, household baptisms_, etc. When such a contradiction occurs between Scripture and anyone or anything else including a [**dream**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dreams.htm), vision, prophecy, experience, testimony, report or even something written by someone labeled a church _father_ like those men, then the Bible wins out. **(Please know that the so-called ante-Nicean fathers contradicted themselves on many issues, as well as contradicting the Scriptures.)**


## The Conclusion About _Infant Baptism_

**In conclusion, no Christian should have anything to do with _infant baptism_ for any reason. _Infant baptism_ is not Biblical and therefore not _Christian._ Furthermore, _infant baptism_ is a _baptism_ in name only. If such a person who was subjected to _infant baptism_ should become a real Christian, he is commanded like all others to undergo true Christian baptism. Moreover, the mode of Christian baptism found in the Bible is _immersion_, which is also contrary to most infant baptisms. Lastly, _infant dedication_ has been derived by some from Lk. 2:22,23, but this should never be associated in any way with _infant baptism_. There is no Biblical connection between the unscriptural infant baptism (baby baptism) and infant dedication.**
