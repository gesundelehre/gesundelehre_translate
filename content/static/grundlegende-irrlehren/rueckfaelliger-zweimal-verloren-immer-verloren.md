## Can A Backslider Get Saved Again

[![twice lost always lost](../files/pictures/twice-lost-always-lost-errors.jpg "Twice Lost Always Lost Errors")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal_sin_blasphemy_of_Holy_Spirit.html)

The following email came in concerning those who correctly teach a Christian can lose his salvation and rightly reject _[**eternal security**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)_, but also teach backsliders can never get their salvation back again! Perhaps some have never thought about the adverse ramifications of the _twice lost always lost_ teaching. Here is the actual email:

Evangelical Outreach, perhaps you could provide some Biblical commentary online regarding the topic of _twice lost always lost_ mentioned on page 414 in your book, _The Believer's Conditional Security_. I currently attend a __________ Church and the doctrine of this local church (and most ot the churches of this denomination) is that a Christian can lose his salvation, but once it is lost, there is no hope of heaven. In theological terms, they do not believe in or teach multiple (or repeated) regeneration. The primary Biblical support for this doctrine is Hebrews 6:4-6\. On page 414 of your book, you cited several passages to refute this doctrine, the most compelling being the passage in Luke 15 on the [**prodigal son**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/prodigal-son.html). The Greek in verses 24 and 32 clearly state that the prodigal was dead and is alive _again_ implying that he was previously _spiritually_ alive. You also cited Romans 11:19-23 in your book, but most commentaries that I have read (particularly the modern ones with a dispensational bent) indicate that this reference is to the nation of Israel. Thank you for your time and your online ministry.

## EO Response (In Part)

[[**Bible Answers**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible-answers.html)] Greetings in Jesus’ name. There are really three passages that teach a backslider can return to _salvation:_ Luke 15:24,32; Rom. 11:19-23 and James 5:19,20\. Regarding the one in James, please read this article [**Salvation Observations From James 5:19,20**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/james51920.html)**.** It is true that Rom. 11:19-23 refers to Israel, but it also refers to NT Christians. Notice Rom. 11:21, written to the _saints_ in Rome (Romans 1:7) and says _he will not spare you either_:

For if God did not spare the natural branches, he will not spare you either.

## Problem #1 With Twice Lost Always Lost

A problem arises that many who embrace _twice lost always lost_ have never thought about and that involves **[King David when in _adultery and murder_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html)**. If it really is “twice lost always lost,” then did David lose his salvation through such vile wickedness? They would have to say NO, since David is now in **[heaven](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/what-is-heaven-like.html)**. Hence, they are then indirectly saying one can commit such evil (as he did) and remain saved, which is _a [**license for immorality**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/etlicense.html)._ The truth is: King David lost his salvation by those **[sins](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html)** (Ezek. 18:24; 33:18; Rom. 8:13; **[James 5:19,20](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/james51920.html)**; etc.) and later got it back.

Heb. 6:4-6 is ONLY referring to people who committed _**[eternal sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal_sin_blasphemy_of_Holy_Spirit.html)**_ (not adultery, murder, drunkenness, etc.) so they could return to the synagogues. Hence, the sin of those referred to in Heb. 6:4-6 was not forgivable (as all other sins are), and therefore, they couldn't be renewed again by _repentance_ (Heb. 6:6) as others can. (By the way, we know, among other ways, Heb. 6:4-6 is referring to people who were saved at one time because it alludes to them _repenting_ in the past.)


## Problem #2 With Twice Lost Always Lost

This brings up another issue, namely, for those who backslide, like the prodigal, and sincerely desire to return to God, but think they have been away from God too long or sinned too much. Such _repentant_ people are very distraught and tortured in their minds because they don't know the truth that they can indeed come back to salvation again and once more get off the road to hell. They can be _renewed again by repentance_. However, the _twice lost always lost_ teaching would horrendously deny this fact. Please consult our books and this other article for more information.
