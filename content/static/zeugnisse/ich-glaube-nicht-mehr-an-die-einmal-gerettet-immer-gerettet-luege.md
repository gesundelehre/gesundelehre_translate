# Ich Glaube Nicht Mehr An Die _Einmal Gerettet Immer Gerettet_ Lüge

I have been raised in a **Southern Baptist church** for about thirteen years now. I am __ and **all my life I believed in the [[once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)] doctrine until about three days ago because I had been going much deeper into Scripture**  and was astonished at the solemn warnings Jesus gave and how everyone always has seemed to _accidentally_ overlook them. **I brought the discussion up and man, I tell you, they hate the idea of Conditional Salvation! It is like Satan to them! Someone went as far as to say it could destroy my faith if I kept it up (with me being against _once saved always saved_ and my research with it).** One had also conveniently said that Satan can use Scripture and twist it up and plant seeds in our heads (pointing to me). **But I do not believe in the _once saved always saved_ lie anymore.** I’ve tried to show them warnings but they rationalize and generalize the Scripture citing all sorts of passages (ie - **[No one can snatch them out of my hand](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/john1028.html)**) and excuses (**[they must not have been saved to begin with](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm)**.) In reality I gave up on my discussion… In my youth group it was 9 to 1\. I wasn’t too happy about it. But now that I have seen the truth Scripture makes so much more sense to me. **_Once saved always saved_ distorts Scripture and exchanges the truth of God for a lie.** However as I know it, most of the ___ people that attend _____ Baptist believe _once saved always saved_ and I am going to be hard pressed to get the truth to them. **Your website has helped me see the truth more plainly and has given me the evidence to fight _once saved always saved_.**
