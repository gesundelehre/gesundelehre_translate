## New Christians (New Converts) Have Cause To Rejoice, But Also Need To Be WARNED OF REAL DANGERS


[![New Convert](../../files/pictures/diffwld.jpg "vital truths for new converts")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/new-creation.html)

[![new convert set free from sin](../../files/pictures/difficult-road-to-life.jpg "New converts to Christianity must endure to the end to be saved")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans6.html)

**When a person becomes a true Christian (a _new convert_) he enters a brand new life. In a moment of time he passes from death to life, from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to the power of God. Many things start to happen to him that may be surprising.** (I can still remember what it was like for me when I came to salvation over 35 years ago.) What you are going to read in this article is what I would have greatly benefitted by had I been presented with these vital Scriptural truths back then. **These are not the kinds of things you will readily hear from the typical _pastor_ of our day or [TV](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/tv.htm) or radio teachers who seem more interested in getting people under their influence than spreading the word of life. Nonetheless, these [basic Christian truths](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-basics.htm) are precious _pearls_ for the new convert.** Let's go to the Scriptures and see what they declare.


## The New Convert and Family Division

> **Do not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth.** I did not come to bring peace, but a sword. **For I have come to turn a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law a man's enemies will be the members of his own household. Anyone who loves his father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and anyone who does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.** Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. (Mat 10:34-39)

[![wolves in sheeps clothing are real dangers for new converts](../../files/pictures/wolves-in-sheeps-clothing.jpg "Wolves in sheeps clothing are real dangers for new converts")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm)

**Es ist gewöhnlich für jemandes Familie sich zu _trennen_ wegen Christus, dies geht sogar so weit, dass die eigenen lieben Familienmitglieder zu geistlichen _Feinden_ des neuen Christen**. Falls dies dir passiert, wisse bitte, dass dies genauso vielen Anderen wiederfahren ist. Es ist gut möglich, dass deine ungerettete Familie will, dass du aufhörst die Bibel zu lesen und von ihr zu reden. Sie könnten sich auch _schämen_, dass du die ganze Zeit so _religiös_ bist und werden versuchen dich "herabzukühlen". Lieber neuer Christ, egal wer oder was versucht dich zu behindern in Liebe und Eifer **[devotion to Jesus](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devotion-to-the-lord-jesus-christ.htm), darfst du nicht ihren gottlosen Wünschen nachgeben**. Du musst _**Jesus zuerst lieben**_, welches sich zeigen wird, indem du ihm mehr gehorchst, als anderen, die wollen, dass du gegen die Lehren des Herrn losgehst, oder sie einfach ignorierst. Es ist lebensnotwendig! **Um Jesus _würdig_ zu sein, müssen wir ihn zuallererst ihn lieben**. Beachte die folgenden 2 Schriftstellen über diejenigen, die Gott **_lieben_**:

> However, as it is written: "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, no mind has conceived what God has prepared for **those who love him**" (1 Cor 2:9)
> 
> Listen, my dear brothers: Has not God chosen those who are poor in the eyes of the world to be rich in faith and **to inherit the kingdom he promised those who love him?** (James 2:5)

We show our love for God by obeying his commands (John 14:15).


## Neu-Bekehrte und Verfolgung 

Ein anderer Fakt deines neuen Lebens in Christus ist, dass es Leute außerhalb deiner Familie stören wird, die kein Herz für die Wahrheit - alte Freunde, Kollegen, Nachbarn etc. Einige dieser Leute werden ihren Ärger durch _Verfolgung_ zeigen auf verschiedene Art und Weise. Sei getöstet und sei ermutigt von dem, was Jesus (und Petrus) lehrten:

[![new converts to christianity baby christians](../../files/pictures/new-convert.jpg "New converts to Christianity")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/new-creation.html)

> **Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me**. Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you. (Mat 5:10-12)
> 
> **Blessed are you when men hate you, when they exclude you and insult you and reject your name as evil, because of the Son of Man.** Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because great is your reward in heaven. For that is how their fathers treated the prophets. (Luke 6:22,23)
> 
> They think it strange that **you do not plunge with them into the same flood of dissipation, and they heap abuse on you**. (1 Pet 4:4)

**[Verfolgung](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/persecut.htm)** um der Gerechtigkeit willen, sogar in milder Form von ausgeschlossen werden und beleidigt werden, ist ein _Test_. Ein Resultat davon  ist wahrscheinlich Einsamkeit. Es ist etwas, womit alle Leute Gottes zutun haben, von Zeit zu Zeit. Traurigerweise, sind sogar Christen _abgefallen_ von ihrer Errettung im _Test der Verfolgung_ oder aus Angst davor:[![new convert set free from sin](../../files/pictures/guy-set-free.jpg)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans6.html)

> ... **They believe for a while, but in the time of testing they fall away**. (Luke 8:13)

Also wenn Verfolgung auf dich zukommt als Neuer-Christ, weil du göttlich lebst, fahre fort ihm zu gehorchen und lass ein Licht weiterhin scheinen. Aber erinnere dich daran deine _Perlen nicht den Schweinen_ hinzuwerfen- denjenigen, die mutig dem Wort Gottes Widerstand leisten- denn sie können dich _in Stücke zerreißen_ (Mt. 7:6). Wandle weiter in Glauben und denke über die ewigen Belohnungen für dich, wegen den Verfolgungen. Alle Menschen Gottes der Vergangenheit wurden verfolgt und erlebten Leiden:

> In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus **will be persecuted**. (2 Tim 3:12)
> 
> Others were tortured and refused to be released, so that they might gain a better resurrection. Some faced jeers and flogging, while still others were chained and put in prison. They were stoned ; they were sawed in two; they were put to death by the sword. They went about in sheepskins and goatskins, destitute, persecuted and mistreated - **the world was not worthy of them**. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and in caves and holes in the ground. **These were all commended for their faith**, yet none of them received what had been promised. (Heb 11:35-39)
> 
> By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be known as the son of Pharaoh's daughter. **He chose to be mistreated along with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a short time**. He regarded disgrace for the sake of Christ as of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. By faith he left Egypt, not fearing the king's anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible. (Heb 11:24-27)

We must be willing to die for Jesus if necessary and never be ashamed of Him or His words (Lk. 9:26).


## Die Notwendigkeit  des _Wissens_ für den Neu-Bekehrten zum Christentum 

Ähnlicherweise, lehrte Jesus:

> All this I have told you **so that you will not go astray**. (John 16:1).

**Deswegen ist Wissen einiger Dinge vorbeugend vom Abkommen vom _Rechten Weg_ oder vom _Stolpern_**. Im Umkehrschluss kommen manche vom rechten Weg ab, weil sie sich nicht der Dinge, auf die Jesus sich bezog, bewusst sind. Laset uns den Zusammenhang überprüfen um zu erkennen, wovon Jesus sprach:

> If the world hates you, keep in mind that it hated me first. If you belonged to the world, it would love you as its own. As it is, you do not belong to the world, but I have chosen you out of the world. That is why the world hates you. Remember the words I spoke to you: 'No servant is greater than his master.' **If they persecuted me, they will persecute you also**. If they obeyed my teaching, they will obey yours also. They will treat you this way because of my name, for they do not know the One who sent me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not be guilty of sin. Now, however, they have no excuse for their sin. He who hates me hates my Father as well. If I had not done among them what no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen these miracles, and yet they have hated both me and my Father. But this is to fulfill what is written in their Law: 'They hated me without reason.' When the Counselor comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of truth who goes out from the Father, he will testify about me. And **you also must testify**, for you have been with me from the beginning. (John 15:18-27)



## Neu-Bekehrte sind berufen folgendes zu sein: **[_Zeugen_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/witnessing.html)**

Jesus lehrte, dass das Wissen,was wir brauchen, um nicht vom rechten Weg abzukommen, ist, dass **wir verfolgt werden und, dass wir Zeugnis von Jesus ablegen müssen**. Wir sind alle berufenen, _Zeugen_ des Herrn zu sein in diesem dunklen, sündenverfluchten Zeitalter (Apg 1:8). Das ist, was die Christen des ersten Jahrhunderts waren, nach der Apostelgeschichte. 

Als ich anfing anderen Zeugnis abzulegen von Jesus, gab ich den Menschen einfach Gottes Wort. Manchmal wurde mir eine Frage gestellt, die ich nicht beantworten konnte. Ich würde ihnen sagen, "Ich komme gleich nochmal drauf zurückkommen."            Das gab mir die Chance nach einer Antwort in der Bibel zu suchen. Nach einer Weile wird dein Können fließend zu predigen verbeseert, wenn du weiter das Wort Gottes liest und studierst. **Erinnere dich, Leute um dich herum gehen in die Hölle und sie müssen dringend die Wahrheit über die Errettung wissen.**

**An excellent way to spread God's eternal truths to others is by having a [personal tract ministry](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/tracts.htm), but be sure to use only Biblically sound literature - literature that clearly tells one he must repent (turn from sin) to be saved from Hell. Moreover, don't distribute literature that teaches or implies the lie of [eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html), even if it is free**. Our ministry makes available an excellent and very popular dual-colored salvation tract on _Heaven and Hell_ with the vitals about the **[plan of salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)**. We also have an important article on _tract evangelism._


<big>**[Learn How EASY _Gospel Tract Evangelism_ Is](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/tracts.htm)**</big>

The true gospel, which we are to spread, includes the following truth:

> By this gospel you are saved, **if you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain.** (1 Cor 15:2)


<a name="newconverts"></a>
## Old Friends of the New Convert

**If you are like many other new converts, when you first came to the Lord, all your friends are ungodly**. In fact, some new converts don't even know a single Christian! But now that you are a follower of Jesus, at least some if not all of these old friends won't like your new priorities. In fact, some might even try to get you to sin or snare you somehow with wickedness. They want you back the way you were when you readily sinned as they still do. Scripture states:

> ... do not share in the sins of others. **[Keep yourself pure](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/keep-yourself-pure.html)**. (1 Tim 5:22)

<big>**[How To Be Victorious Over Sexual Temptation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sexualtemptation.htm)**</big>

<big><big>**[Can Your Name Be Blotted From The Book Of Life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-life.html)**</big></big>

**Sin can make a holy person unholy and a pure person impure and no longer fit to enter heaven**. It can bring a true Christian to his **[spiritual death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)** (Rom. 8:13; James 1:14,15 cf. Lk. 15:24,32; etc.). Hence, after you tell your old friends your stand for God, if they want to continue in their sin, don't hang out with them anymore. DANGER: To continue to spend time and go places with such people will open you to spiritual dangers that would never exist otherwise:

> Do not be misled: "**Bad company corrupts good character**." (1 Cor 15:33)

**Remember, your old unsaved friends are in darkness and spiritual death. They do not think or react like you. They are also on the road to Hell, even though they don't know it.**

One of the shocking (and vital) truths I learned in the Bible is that Christians are to _avoid_ certain people, places and things. Remember also if Eve would never have gone near that tree with the forbidden fruit she would have never been tempted, which led to her sin and leading Adam into sin also. So avoid places of temptation like swimming pools, beaches, discos, Las Vegas, etc. It is also important to dress modestly so you won't cause another to sin (1 Tim. 2:9). The wicked dress to get others, if possible, to **[lust](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lust.html)** after their body! Remember also Rom. 12:2:

> **Do not conform any longer to the pattern of this world**, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is - his good, pleasing and perfect will. (Rom 12:2)
> 
> **Do not be yoked together with unbelievers.** For what do righteousness and wickedness have in common? Or what fellowship can light have with darkness? What harmony is there between Christ and Belial ? What does a believer have in common with an unbeliever? What agreement is there between the temple of God and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God has said: "I will live with them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they will be my people." **"Therefore come out from them and be separate," says the Lord. "Touch no unclean thing, and I will receive you. I will be a Father to you, and you will be my sons and daughters," says the Lord Almighty.** (2 Cor 6:14-18)



## Keep a Clear Conscience

**One of the striking truths about Paul's strong and faithful walk with God is shown in the following Scripture, which is also very important for the new convert:**

> ... there will be a resurrection of both the righteous and the wicked. So **I strive always to keep my conscience clear before God and man**. (Acts 24:15,16)

**The importance of this is also expressed as a safeguard against shipwrecking your faith:**

> **Holding on to faith and a good conscience. Some have rejected these and so have shipwrecked their faith**. Among them are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan to be taught not to blaspheme. (1 Tim 1:19,20)

**Paul knew the same horrible thing that happened to Hymenaeus and Alexander could also happen to his faithful co-laborer, Timothy. Hence, he gave him these vital responsibilities to follow which would prevent the [loss of salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html). For us to enter the kingdom of God we will have to endure to the end to be saved (Mt. 10:22). See also Hebrews 3:14 and Rev. 2:10,11.** Follow Paul's example and advice to Timothy about keeping a clear conscience. This is also one of the reasons you need to be water baptized by immersion now that you have become a Christian (1 Pet. 3:21). **Any true Christian can water baptize you and it doesn't have to be done in a church building.**


## New Converts, False Teachers and False Prophets

**All new Christians are hungry for God's truth**. Oftentimes they can never get enough of His precious word. This is clear evidence of God's saving grace in one's life. But with this hunger for God's truth a new danger is opened up - **[false teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm)**! One of the great dangers at the end of our age especially is _**[religious deception](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/religious-deception.html)**_. There are false teachers around us. Examples are Calvinists, [**Jehovah's Witnesses**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html), Mormons, [**Catholics**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html), Muslims, the Church of Christ, [**Jesus Only**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/apostolics.html) people and [**Seventh Day Adventists**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sabbath.htm). These people can be very friendly and zealous, but they are spreading deadly false doctrines, especially about salvation and Jesus himself. See Matt. 7:15.

**Beyond them there are also many more false teachers on religious TV and radio, as well as authors of books, articles and tracts, which are not readily known as false teachers.** These would especially include **the eternal security teachers and people compromising with the Catholic church**. (Eternal security is, for the most part, an unrecognized rampant heresy in our dark day.) Without writing a mini book on why these people are so dangerous, suffice it to say they dangerously downplay sin in the life of a Christian and de-emphasize the importance of bringing forth good fruit. **Because of eternal security teachers, multitudes are on the road to hell but think they are on the road to heaven. Consequently, their false doctrine needs to be exposed and refuted, not supported. To support such ministries and local congregations will cause you to share in their wicked work.** (For an exhaustive presentation of this teaching with Scriptural refutation, please see our 801 page book entitled, "[**The Believer's Conditional Security**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dan-corner-the-believers-conditional-security.html).") **Don't just trust what you hear someone teach, even if they are a popular teacher over TV, radio or from a pulpit in a local church. Verify and test everything with the Bible, including miracles. You might be surprised to know that both God and the devil can perform _miracles!_ Click here to read Bible facts about such [miracles](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/miracles.html) or obtain it from our ministry.**


## Churches or _Death Traps?_

Hand in hand with the danger of false teachers can be _going to church_! **Strangely, many churches are spiritual death traps**. Most often the pastor and elder board are apostate themselves and therefore cannot offer sound doctrine and true godly leadership. Such congregational leaders will lull a new convert into lukewarmness and worldliness as they take money from them! This would also include any congregation that would teach one can commit _occasional_ acts of adultery and murder, like King David did, and still remain saved. If the Christian doesn't flee from such an environment he will often die spiritually because of such a church. It is better and safer to witness to those going to such a local church **after you leave it**. The Christian of our day might have to gather with just a few other true believers in a home where they can worship and seek God together, since a sound congregation is _hard_ to find in our present apostasy.

Finally, oftentimes the so-called spiritual leaders themselves and the other people in a modern-day church often _hurt_ others, especially new converts. For the spiritual health and well being of the Christian, the follower of Jesus must forgive others so his sins can likewise be forgiven (Mt. 6:14,15).


## New Converts and Music

**Godly music will definitely prove to be a tremendous blessing to the new convert. On the other hand, secular music in the form of rock 'n roll, country, oldies, etc. will adversely affect you spiritually. Hence, all music which is not spiritually edifying is potentially dangerous and should be avoided. Again, don't listen to such music at all.** I remember hearing a testimony of a woman who fell away from the Lord for a time, which all began because she started listening to country music. Also, remember that just because music might be religious doesn't mean it is doctrinally sound. **Many dangerous anti-scriptural concepts are conveyed in so-called "gospel" music! You should examine the words of a song as you would a teaching - checking it with the Scriptures.**


## [TV](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/tv.htm) and the New Convert

**Perhaps the greatest tool the devil has in the early part of the twenty-first century is television**, which can be magnetizing. The sights and sounds can stay with a person long after the show is over. The Bible says:

> For to be carnally minded _is_ **death**; but to be spiritually minded _is_ **life and peace**. (Rom 8:6)

Since TV shows are produced by ungodly people to draw ungodly people, much harm can come to the Christian, especially new converts, through such besides it being a waste of precious time which could be used to serve God. Even religious TV is far from being beneficial to the viewer with all those false teachers on there, as already mentioned.


## The Bible is Final Authority

**Another vitally important fact for new Christians is the [Bible is final authority](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html). This means if an experience, vision, dream, prophecy, teaching, testimony, sensation, feeling, etc. contradicts the written word of God then reject it. It is not God's truth. Furthermore, you won't ever need more than the Bible to accurately learn about salvation and what God wants from you in this life. Some dangerously think you need to supplement the Bible with Sacred Tradition, the [Book of Mormon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon.htm), the Koran, the writings of the ante-Nicene Fathers, etc.** The Bible reads:

> All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work. (2 Tim 3:16,17)

The man of God is thoroughly equipped for every good work with the Scriptures alone. If someone thinks the Scriptures are not sufficient then **he must not be a man of God! Finally, avoid so-called study Bibles with _notes_. The _notes_ in them are often wrong and don't deserve the same space on the page as Scripture.**


## What Bible Translation for the New Convert

**As a new Christian, I was misled into thinking the [King James Version of the Bible is the most accurate translation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/kjvonly.html) we can read. Consequently, I spent a number of years struggling over this hard to read and misleading Elizabethan English translation. Many [words in the KJV are words that readers have never seen before](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/kjvo.htm). Hence, readers of the KJV will often just take a guess at their meanings, while many other words seem to be commonly known but in reality have a different meaning from everyday life. All this adds up to frustration and hindrances in understanding God's precious, eternal word. Don't be deceived by KJV Onlyites who say the KJV is not hard to understand**. Obtain a reliable, easy to read and understand translation of the Bible like the New American Standard, New International Version or ESV. In fact, switch off from these three translations for shades of meanings that are not apparent otherwise. Stay in the New Testament to learn especially what Jesus and his apostles taught about salvation. After you read through it perhaps 10 times, then start to learn the Old Testament while you also continue to read the New Testament.


## New Converts Should [Memorize Scripture](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/audio/Memorize.mp3)

**Memorizing God's eternal word will have various benefits throughout your entire [Christian life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-life.html)**. There are various reasons why this will help to strengthen, guide and encourage you as it also bolsters your faith to face each new day. The [**devil**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html) will try to hinder you from memorizing God's word. Stick with it and your blessings from such will be great:

> How can a young man keep his way pure? By living according to your word. I seek you with all my heart; do not let me stray from your commands. **I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you.** (Psa 119:9-11)


## New Convert, Your Soul Is Most Precious

**Nothing you own now or ever will own can compare with the value of your soul. Therefore, you need to [guard your SOUL](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/safegard.html) carefully. See Prov. 4:23\. Heaven is real, but so is Hell. To enter the kingdom of Heaven and escape Hell there are things you must do for yourself now that you are saved, so that you will stay saved. There is salvation maintenance and effort that needs to be exerted to stay with God. That is true [salvation security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/salvation-security.htm). See 2 Peter 1:5-12\. Also, notice what the Lord Jesus taught:**

> Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them, **"Make every effort to enter through the narrow door, because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to."** (Luke 13:23,24)

It is worth any sacrifice to enter God's eternal, paradise kingdom and escape eternal punishment in Hell fire. The road to life is _hard_ (Mt. 7:14) and there are _enemies_ along the way, besides the devil, so you will have to dress yourself with the whole armor of God and continue in the faith, even through the rough times that will sometimes come:

> "We must go through **many hardships to enter the kingdom of God**," they said. (Acts 14:22)

You have a glorious future before you that cannot properly be expressed in words. See Rev. 21:4; Phil. 1:21-23; 1 Cor. 2:9; Isa. 35:10; etc.

New Christian or old Christian, **keep your eyes on Jesus, your hand to the plow and don't look back.** Immerse yourself in the Bible (especially the New Testament at first) and **put into practice what you read**. Jesus described the true Christians (his real spiritual family) as:

> He replied, "My mother and brothers are **those who hear God's word and put it into practice**." (Luke 8:21)

Several good daily prayers are:

> May **the words of my mouth** and the **meditation of my heart** be pleasing in your sight, O LORD, my Rock and my Redeemer. (Psa 19:14)
> 
> **Turn my heart toward your statutes and not toward selfish gain. Turn my eyes away from worthless things**; preserve my life according to your word. (Psa 119:36,37)
> 
> Direct my footsteps according to your word; **let no sin rule over me**. (Psa 119:133)
