## The How, Why and Where To Use Gospel Tracts For Witnessing

[![use gospel tracts](../../files/pictures/use-gospel-tracts.jpg "Use gospel tracts everywhere you go.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sctracts.html)

**Gospel tracts for witnessing are easy to use! This web page will give Christians important ideas and instructions on how, why and where to use _gospel tracts for soul winning._** In fact, after decades of personal experience I must say **it is as easy as _driving a car_ as it is to use gospel tracts (or bible tracts) for effective witnessing in an endeavor to rescue the lost and perishing.** There isn't any solid reason for any saint to refrain from this VERY EASY and fruitful means of personal evangelism to **[spread the gospel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/entrusted.htm)**.

**The two main hindrances will be _fear and discouragement,_ but neither should stop you! Again, it's like learning how to drive a car. Did fear or discouragement stop you? NO! You knew it was something you needed to learn and you did. It is the same with using gospel tracts for [Christian evangelism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-evangelism.html)**.

## How To Use Gospel Tracts For Witnessing

[![witnessing gospel tracts](../../files/pictures/lost-soul-eternal-fire.jpg "ONLY JESUS can save you and set you free from your sin addictions.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html)

**The first thing you must have is biblically sound gospel tracts. Do NOT use tracts just because they are free or because they are illustrated! [Chick tracts are NOT sound](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/chick-tracts-are-not-sound-beware/). Check the message of any gospel tract in question to the scriptures carefully. WHY? Because you will be spreading the message contained on the bible tract you distribute! It is therefore your responsibility to deliver the clearest and best to help lost people find forgiveness and a purpose to live.** Such is the MOST IMPORTANT job a person can have in this dark world. You will be helping people with their greatest need, even though many don't know what their greatest need is! That will definitely include church-goers because we are in a wide-spread apostasy! The bible tracts need to mention **[REPENTANCE FOR SALVATION](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)** (with repentance meaning TO TURN FROM EVIL). **The FOCUS MUST BE [FAITH IN JESUS for salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/believing.html). NEVER use any tract that teaches or implies [once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) or any other form of [Calvinism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html).**

So once you have sound gospel tracts in your possession you need to sow those gospel seeds as far and wide as possible. Pray before going forth. Walk down a public sidewalk and extend your arm with the gospel tract so it is EASY for the potential recipient to receive it from your hand. Remain calm as you say something like, "Did you get one of these" OR "Here sir" or "Here Ma'am." I have said many different things to people as I have handed them gospel tracts, including "Good reading" and "Better than money." **[View pictures of an evangelism event using salvation tracts](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/EvangelismPictures.htm).**

**The blessing to observe someone read the gospel tract is beyond words. That same person can take that same gospel tract home and look up all the verses in their Bible for verification, if they want. That is a main advantage over a verbal witness, which in many cases will soon be forgotten.**

## The Great Soul Winning Gospel Preaching Commission

According to Scripture, every Christian **with no exception**, has been commissioned to **[spread the Gospel of the Lord Jesus](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/entrusted.htm)**. Please ponder the following **[spread the gospel Scriptures](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/entrusted.htm)**:

[![christian soldier loaded down with gospel tracts](../../files/pictures/servant1.jpg "Gospel tracts NEVER forget!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/witnessing.html)

> **Therefore go and make disciples of all nations**, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Mt. 28:19).
> 
> He said to them, **Go into all the world and preach the good news to all creation** (Mk. 16:15).
> 
> He told them, This is what is written: The Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and **[repentance and forgiveness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)** of [sins](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html) will be preached in his name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem. You are witnesses of these things (Lk. 24:46-48).
> 
> **He commanded us to preach to the people** and to testify that he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead (Acts 10:42).
> 
> How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And **how can they hear without someone preaching to them**? (Rom. 10:14).
> 
> **Remember your leaders, who spoke the word of God to you. Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith** (Heb. 13:7).
> 
> All this is from God, who reconciled us to himself through Christ and gave us **the ministry of reconciliation** (2 Cor. 5:18).

Regardless who you are as a **[Christian](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html)** you can fulfill your responsibility as a _minister of reconciliation_, in part, by distributing doctrinally sound gospel literature.



## Advantages of Using Gospel Tracts

[![christian soldier loaded down with gospel literature](../../files/pictures/servant2.jpg "Gospel tracts are VERY EASY to use!")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-life.html)

Salvation tracts have many advantages over a verbal witness, though we must never downplay the verbal message of the Gospel. Please consider that gospel literature: **never** forgets to make the intended points about the Gospel; **never** is too busy to do its job; **never** gets sick or injured; **never** compromises with the truth; **never** argues but will always boldly and unashamedly witness to every person, regardless who they are; can be reread by thousands of people over many years in many different places; speaks out its message when it is most convenient and opportune to the recipient of the tract and can be easily verified, if Scripture references are cited in it.

Gospel tracts penetrates homes, prisons, hospitals, offices and foreign countries. Though you can't speak a foreign language, you can distribute gospel literature in that language and still be effectively understood for the Gospel's sake. Tracts can be passed on to one person after another and continue to bring forth salvations. This is what happened for our ministry as we sent a Bible and a few of our own salvation tracts to a person in Ghana, Africa. He in turn passed one of our tracts on to his friend, who repented after reading it and talking to a friend.

Tracts can give the salvation message to those **[never saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/neversavedargument.htm)**, to those once saved but now lost; and beyond that they encourage those currently saved. In fact, Christians are to affect other Christians in the following good way:

> And let us consider how we may **spur one another on toward love and good deeds** (Heb. 10:24).

**A good example, such as a Christian distributing gosel tracts, can do this in part!** Furthermore, the following command is also being obeyed by those that spread gospel tracts:

> Be very careful, then, how you live - not as unwise but as wise, **making the most of every opportunity**, because the days are evil (Eph. 5:15,16).

## Where To Use Gospel Tracts

**Though gospel tracts ideally should be handed directly to people, they are also effective if left laying around for someone to pick up! Any Christian, regardless how new in the faith, can leave gospel tracts lay around.** Salvation tracts can be used at airports, amusement parks, apartment complexes, arcades, ball games, banks, bus terminals, toll booths, conventions, county fairs, at doctor's offices, flea markets, garage sales, gas stations, parades, in cigarette, pop and candy machines, greeting cards, restaurants with your tip, in restrooms, subways, trains, busy street corners, elevators, hotel rooms, telephone booths, on bulletin boards, college campuses and other places you visit from time to time. An ideal time to hand someone a bible tract is often when they are in a parked car waiting for their family member or friend to return, such as in a parking lot at a shopping mall or grocery store. Try enclosing one in each envelope when you pay your bills. Day or night bible tracts can do their job because they are God's truth!

[![soul winning christian life](../../files/pictures/soul-winners-gospel-tracts-evangelize.jpg "Early Christian life included SUFFERING for the sake of SOULS.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-evangelism.html)


## Accountable For Someone's Blood

Christian witnessing and warning of sin's dangers are the only way to save yourself from another's **_blood_**:

> Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; so hear the word I speak and give them warning from me. When I say to the wicked, 'O wicked man, you will surely die,' and you do not speak out to dissuade him from his ways, that wicked man will die for his sin, and **I will hold you accountable for his blood**. But if you do warn the wicked man to turn from his ways and he does not do so, he will die for his sin, but **you will have saved yourself** (Ezek. 33:7-9).

Surely Paul considered that passage **a New Testament responsibility**, as we read in the following:

> But when the Jews opposed Paul and became abusive, he shook out his clothes in protest and said to them, "**Your blood be on your own heads! I am clear of my responsibility**. From now on I will go to the Gentiles" (Acts 18:6).

> Therefore, I declare to you today that **I am innocent of the blood of all men**. For I have not hesitated to proclaim to you the whole will of God (Acts 20:26,27).


## How Does God View The Soul Winner?

[![christian soldier fulfilling the Great Commission with gospel traces](../../files/pictures/gospel-tract-distribution.jpg "Gospel tracts can be mailed to people.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelicals.htm)

> The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and **he who wins souls is wise** (Prov. 11:30).
> 
> Those who are **wise** will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and **those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever** (Dan. 11:3).
> 
> How beautiful on the mountains are the feet of **those who bring good news, who proclaim peace, who bring good tidings, who proclaim salvation, who say to Zion, "Your God reigns!"** (Isa. 52:7).


## Ask Yourself This Question!

**If all Christians during all the ages were as zealous, faithful, committed and serious about winning souls as YOU, would there be more or less people in [Hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html) today?**

A Christian distributing gospel literature should be tactful and polite. He should also be kind and patient, like he'd want the person to whom he is witnessing to be to him if the tables were turned. Remember the following:

> And the Lord's servant **must not quarrel**; instead, he **must be kind to everyone**, able to **teach, not resentful**. Those who oppose him he must **gently instruct**, in the hope that God will grant them repentance leading them to a knowledge of the truth, and that they will come to their senses and escape from the trap of the devil, who has taken them captive to do his will (2 Tim. 2:24-26).
> 
> Always be prepared to give an answer to everyone who asks you to give the reason for the hope that you have. But do this with **gentleness and respect**, keeping a **clear conscience**, so that those who speak maliciously against your good behavior in Christ may be ashamed of their slander (1 Pet. 3:15,16).

If possible, the soul winner should _never_ hand out wrinkled or dirty gospel tracts. Again, would you want someone to hand you a piece of literature that is less than good in appearance? Not likely!

## Should We Not Be Like Paul Regarding The Salvation Of Others?

What was his attitude regarding this?

> I try to please everybody in every way. For **I am not seeking my own good but the good of many, so that they may be saved** (1 Cor. 10:33).

For souls to be saved, they must first hear and receive the **[word of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wordgod.html)**. See Luke 8:11-15\. Furthermore, the early Christians, from all walks of life, _held out the word of life:_

> Do everything without complaining or arguing, so that you may become blameless and pure, children of God without fault in a crooked and depraved generation, in which you shine like stars in the universe **as you hold out the word of life** - in order that I may boast on the day of Christ that I did not run or labor for nothing (Phil. 2:14-16).

Unlike in our day, first-century Christians witnessed! Male and females all spread the salvation message. It was not just the apostles, as we learn from the persecution connected with Stephen:

> On that day a great persecution broke out against the church at Jerusalem, and **all except the apostles were scattered** throughout Judea and Samaria. Godly men buried Stephen and mourned deeply for him. But Saul began to destroy the church. Going from house to house, he dragged off men and women and put them in prison. **Those who had been scattered preached the word wherever they went** (Acts 8:1-4).
> 
> **Now those who had been scattered** by the persecution in connection with Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, **telling the message** only to Jews. Some of them, however, men from Cyprus and Cyrene, went to Antioch and began to speak to Greeks also, **telling them the good news about the Lord Jesus. The Lord's hand was with them, and a great number of people believed and turned to the Lord** (Acts 11:19-21).

NOTE: only the apostles stayed in Jerusalem. All of the other Christians left Jerusalem and witnessed as they traveled! Consider also the following:

> **The Lord's message rang out from you** not only in Macedonia and Achaia - your faith in God has become known everywhere (1 Thess. 1:8).
> 
> As you sent me into the world, **I have sent them into the world** (John 17:18).

In John 17:18, the context reveals that the pronoun _them_ refers to **all** of the Lord's disciples, that is, all Christians. Another similar Scripture is the following one:

> But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you; and **you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth** (Acts 1:8).

Again, the context shows it was the 120 in the upper room (Acts 1:15) and not just the Lord's apostles that were to be His _witnesses to the ends of the earth_. That number was composed of both men and women!

In our day, salvation literature will help in this noble endeavor of spreading the Lord's Gospel. Yet, it seems that few realize how important Bible tracts are as they continue to let precious witnessing opportunities slip through their fingers to the eternal detriment of others and themselves as well. Remember we can be held accountable for another's blood.

Friend, if you don't have a tract ministry, start one today! It takes very little effort to get literature out, even for shy people. Let our ministry help you with our own favorite salvation tract written by this ministry. It has a message of Heaven, printed in blue, on one side and a message of Hell, printed in red, on the other side. Both sides are loaded with relevant truths about salvation that sometimes will stop people in their tracks as they read it! We've seen this on multiple occasions.

## For The Second Time -- Use Only Sound Bible Tracts For Witnessing

**As mentioned at the beginning of this article, gospel literature should be Biblically "sound." Don't just hand out any so-called _gospel tract_ because it is cheap or even free. Especially make sure the [heresy of eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) is not taught in it, since we don't want to share in the evil work of that false gospel, false grace and "license for immorality."** Moreover, the traditional **[_Romans Road to salvation_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans-road.htm)** presentation omits too many key verses in Romans like Rom. 2:7; 8:13; 11:19-23 and 13:11 related to salvation. Therefore, it is better to avoid it. Finally, **all sound gospel literature will include [repentance](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html) for salvation's sake** (2 Pet. 3:9; Acts 20:21; etc.). **Repentance means _turning from evil_. [God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.html)** bless you as you go forth with His life-giving message.
