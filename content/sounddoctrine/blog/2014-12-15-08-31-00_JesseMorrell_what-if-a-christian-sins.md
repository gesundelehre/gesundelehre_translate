<p><strong>What if a Believer Sins – Part 1 (<a href="http://gesundelehre.tk/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3lvdXR1LmJlL2xxdGZvVGJYUldF&feed-stats-url-post-id=1">http://youtu.be/lqtfoTbXRWE</a>)</strong></p>
<p>Ok, I’d like to pray again, before we start here:</p>
<p>Father, I just want to give you this time, give you this meeting, that you could use me to minister your word Lord, that you’ll minister to us, what you want us to hear, that our hearts will be open and receptive, father i pray for the anointing and blessing of your holy spirit, that your spirit will be here Lord, speaking to us and ministering to us, Lord, that we could perfectly do your will, that we could know your truth, love your truth, preach your truth and live your truth Lord. So I just pray for your hand to be upon us, lead us and guide us Lord and correct us and comfort us, strengthen us Lord, that we could glorify your name, that we could glorify you, that we could bring honor and glory unto your son Jesus Christ. Oh Lord. So we just give you this time and ask that you use it. In Jesus’ name, Amen.</p>
<p>I want to talk to you today about if a believer sins, how do you deal with sin – as a Christian if you commit sin, what do you do. I think there’s many people, who have come up with many different ways of dealing with this situation. If a believer sins, they find the pains of their conscience and the guilt of their mind, realizing what they’ve done was wrong and they cope with this and deal with this in different ways. I think people have come up with many, what I call sin-friendly doctrines – doctrines that make people comfortable in their sins and that they appeal to these doctrines when they are guilty and conscious of their sin. So I want to talk about some of these doctrines and expose them and then answer the question: “What if a believer sins?”, “What if a Christian sins?”</p>
<p>The first sort of sin-friendly doctrine, which is very common in our day – a doctrine, people will appeal to for false comfort – is the idea that, in order to be saved you don’t really need to repent of your sins at all, all you need to do is believe. It’s known as “easy believism”. And the people will appeal to scriptures that say you need to believe in Christ and have you put your faith in Christ but to the neglection of the scriptures that talk about you’re actually repenting and turning from your sins. So some people they find themselves in sin and they say “well, I believe in Jesus even though I’ve sinned and I am sinning, I believe in Christ and therefore I’m saved” and they try to comfort their hearts and ease their conscience on this appeal that “well, so long as I’m believing in Christ, I’m OK”. But James tells us, that the devils believe and tremble. If you simply say you believe in Christ, but you don’t live a holy life, you don’t believe in Christ to such a degree that you actually start obeying him and loving him. Then you really have nothing more than the devils’ faith, a faith like the devil. If it’s not a faith that purifies the heart the Bible says or a faith that overcomes the world or a sanctifying faith, that talks about those who are sanctified by faith, if we don’t have a real active dynamic faith that purifies our heart and cleanses our life than it’s nothing more than the devils’ faith. But the Bible not only tells us to believe, the Bible tells us to repent. And we see like Isaiah 55:7 says: “Let the wicked forsake his way, the unrighteous man his thoughts” or the Bible says in proverbs “whosoever confesses and forsaketh his sin, shall find mercy”. It’s not enough just to say that you believe in Christ. It’s not enough just to put your faith in Christ and yet not change your life. A true faith is a repentant faith. True faith is an obedient faith. And any faith that is not a repentant and obedient faith is not a saving faith at all. Some people will attack repentance, the idea that you need to repent of your sins and they call it works-based salvation. I don’t know how many times I’ve been accused of preaching works-based salvation cause I tell people they need to actually give up their sins. The scriptures that people appeal to, that they’ll use to try to attack the idea of real turning away from your sin will be the writings of Paul which is not that surprising because Peter said that Pauls writings were in fact hard to be understood and unlearned men, ungodly men would twist then to their own destruction. So it doesn’t surprise me that many false doctrines come out of a misunderstanding of Pauls writings which is what Peter said would happen. But when Paul was talking about those who believed in being justified by the works of the law, he wasn’t talking about preachers of repentance – John the baptist was a preacher of repentance, it says “he preached the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins” – when Paul was talking about those who were preaching salvation by works, justification by works of the law he was targeting the judaizers. The judaizers were going around, saying that you need to obey the torah, the law was the first five books of Moses. Leviticus, Deuteronomy and so forth. These judaizers were saying if a gentile wants to be saved they need to essentially become jewish in their practice, in their tradition, in their manner. They need to be circumcised and they need to follow the dietary laws and these other things. So when Paul was coming against the idea of justification by works of the law what he was saying was that gentiles by simply putting their faith in Christ, a true and living faith, they’re justified, not by obeying the torah and not by being circumcised. If you study Romans where Paul talked about justification by works of the law you’ll see how he connected it with circumcision. And he says, so a man is justified apart from circumcision as Abraham was justified before circumcision. Or Galatians, Paul talks about justification by works of the law. In Galatians it wasn’t that the Galatians were repenting of their sins and Paul taught, well I better put a stop to this. The judaizers came through. And the judaizers were telling these gentiles, the Galatians, that they needed to be circumcised and obey the torah in order to be saved. That was the situation that was dealt with in the book of Acts – the judaizers. And so the book of Galatians explains how the gentiles do not need to be circumcised and obey the torah. I think, if you want to see an example of how gentiles get saved, look at Niniveh. It says Niniveh believed God and they turned from their wickedness and then God in his mercy changed his mind about destroying the city. A gentile is saved by believing God and turning from sin, that’s true faith, a real repentant and obedient, lifechanging and heart purifying faith in God and trust in his word. I would also say, against the idea of just an easy believism, that if you really love God, if you really trust God, you’ll do what he says. If you’re truly confident in Gods character, confident in Gods wisdom then you’re not going to question his commands. When he tells you to do something you’ll do it out of that faith and if we’re finding ourselves in deliberate disobedience towards God and conscious rebellion against the word of God then it must be, that we’re not truly putting our faith in his character, in his faith, in his wisdom. Because he’s an infinite being, his mind is superior to our own, his goodness is superior to our own and so we should never question what he tells us to do, we should always willingly and eagerly do what he tells us to do, because he is superior and supreme and he’s good. So a true faith will be an obedient faith to God.</p>
<p><strong>What if a Believer Sins – Part 2 (<a href="http://gesundelehre.tk/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3lvdXR1LmJlL2huMjNlVURiWTFn&feed-stats-url-post-id=1">http://youtu.be/hn23eUDbY1g</a>)</strong></p>
<p>But another thing, people say when they find themselves in sin and they cope with it and deal with it. They’ll say, “well when God looks at me he doesn’t see me, he sees the “imputed righteousness” of Christ instead”. I’ve heard people say this. They say “God looks as a believer in sin. God doesn’t see the believers sin and God doesn’t see the character of a Christian if he’s sinning. God sees the imputed righteousness of Christ instead. The problem with this is that it would be a denial of Gods omniscience, the Bible says the eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good. To say God doesn’t see you is just ridiculous on its face. God sees everyone, good and evil. If we see in Revelations Jesus wrote letters to the churches, and Jesus’ letters reveal, that God clearly saw their works, that’s what he would say, I see your works, be zealous therefore and repent. Multiple times to multiple churches he said I see your works. He didn’t say I see the imputed righteousness of Christ, he said I see your works be zealous therefore and repent. When we’re in sin, if we’re in sin, God sees it. Nothing is hid from his eyes, so the idea that we’re hiding behind the imputed righteousness of Christ, God doesn’t see us when we sin, it’s false comfort. Now the Bible does talk about imputed righteousness in Romans chapter 4 and its synonymous with forgiveness. The Bible says blessed are those whose iniquities are covered whose transgressions are forgiven whom the Lord will not impute sin. Paul was quoting from David in the book of Psalms and imputed righteousness simply means God considers you and treats you as righteous. That’s included in pardon and forgiveness. But the idea that God doesn’t see us when we’re sinning – it’s not biblical.</p>
<p>Gods forgiveness is conditional. Like I said, not only is faith a condition of forgiveness, but so is repentance, that if we expect God to forgive us and to treat us as righteous we need to turn from our sins and when a man truly turns from his sins and puts his faith in Christ, even though he has sinned and deserves punishment, God will impute him as righteous, treat him as righteous, even he hasn’t lived righteous.</p>
<p>Another doctrine people will misuse and abuse is that of the “atonement”. If a believer’s in sin they’ll say: “well, Christ died for my sins, past, present and future, therefore no sin I could ever commit could ever put me under the penalty of the law. No sin I commit could ever condemn me before God. Christ has taken care of all my sins, past, present and future”. Now it’s true, that Christ has died for all sins of all people, past, present and future. But he didn’t die to give us a license to sin. He didn’t die so we could just be forgiven in advance. He didn’t die so we could just break the law of God with impunity. Christ died, providing an atonement for us so that if the wicked forsakes his way God, could pardon them. Christ didn’t die so that repentance would be nullified, or repentance could be done away with, Gods government could be overthrown or Gods law could be dishonored and disobeyed with impunity. Christ died to purify a people, the Bible says, to purify unto himself a people zealous for good works. And so that if we actually give our lives back to God, turn back to God, then God would forgive us. So yes, Christ died for our sins past, present and future, but we’re not actually forgiven of our sins past, present and future unless we give up our sins past, present and future. Repentance must always come before forgiveness. Repentance always comes before the remission of sins.</p>
<p>With the atonement, I would say, salvation was made available to all men at Calvary, but salvation does not become actual for any man until conversion, that even though Christ died for us 2000 years ago, we’re not actually saved until we’re converted. Without repentance and faith we abide under the wrath of God, that’s what the Bible says, after your impenitent heart treasurest up for yourself wrath that will be revealed in the day of wrath. So God does not actually turn from his wrath until sinners return from their sins. God doesn’t actually set aside his wrath unless we set aside our rebellion. But if we continue in our sins, and continue in our rebellion, then we’re continuing and abiding under the wrath of God. That’s what the Bible says, the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and worldly lust and the Bible says, you’re treasuring up for yourself wrath that will be revealed in the day of wrath. As it says that wrath of God is coming upon the children of disobedience. So if we continue in impenitence, continue in disobedience, then we’re abiding under the wrath of God. Even though Christ has died for our sins past, presence and future. Unless we give up our sins, we’re not actually forgiven.</p>
<p><strong>What If a Believer Sins – Part 3 (<a href="http://gesundelehre.tk/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3lvdXR1LmJlL2tweGlCWkhRLTR3&feed-stats-url-post-id=1">http://youtu.be/kpxiBZHQ-4w</a>)</strong></p>
<p>And then another doctrine, that’s sin-friendly and accomplice of sin, which makes people comfortable in their sin is just “once saved always saved” and that’s one of the worst and there’s different degrees and variations of this doctrine but it essentially says if you ever had a moment of faith then you’re saved once and for all, even if you backslide and you start – some people will say, even if you become a Muslim or a Hindu, that if you ever had a moment of faith in Christ, you’re still saved. But the Bible teaches, that we can fall away from the faith. Paul says that he would keep his body under subjection lest after he’s preached to others, he himself become a castaway. Then the Bible says that the Jews were cut off and we were grafted in, but let’s not be haughty and fear lest we also be cut off. Jesus said, he that perseveres unto the end, shall be saved. So the idea that well, that if you’re, once you’re converted – that’s it, it’s a done deal, no matter what you do or how you live, you’re once saved always saved, it’s just contrary to many explicit passages in the Bible. In fact it would be contrary to Gods goodness. The idea of a once saved always saved is essentially a license to sin. And if God gave anyone a license to sin, that would be contrary to the well-being of his whole universe. If a ruler pardoned a criminal and said, “I’m forgiving you for all your crimes, past, present and future and no matter what you do after this point you can never again go to jail and you can live in the community however you want to live, no matter what you do, you’re forgiven”. No community would want that, no community would be safe, no one could trust the intelligence or the goodness of a ruler like that. So God in his goodness and God in his intelligence doesn’t give anyone a license to sin. Sin in order to be forgiven must always be forsaken.</p>
<p>So very simply, if a believer sins, that’s the message, if a believer sins they need to repent. If you’ve sinned you need to repent. Don’t presume, that you’re forgiven in advance. Jesus taught us to pray “father forgive us our sins”. Well to pray for forgiveness implies you don’t already have it. If we sin, if we find ourselves guilty before God, our conscience condemns us, we’re conscious of rebelling against the goodness and righteousness of God, then we need to turn from our sin and ask God to forgive us. Examples would be King David. King David committed adultery and murder – he was a man after Gods own heart, he wasn’t after Gods heart when he was sinning, but he did have a previous character of genuine love for God, but he found himself, he willfully walked into sin, adultery and murder. I think it was a period of 6 months he was in sin. The Bible says, adulterers will not inherit the kingdom of God, we know no murderer has eternal life abiding in him the Bible says. If David had died in that sin, he would have gone to hell. But God sent Nathan the prophet, convicted him, brought him to repentance – Psalms 51 is a sinners prayer so to speak, where David was asking God for mercy and for pardon and forgiveness and he was restored. Well, the only difference between king David and king Saul was repentance. The Bible says Saul prophesied with the prophets, and Saul was given a new heart the Bible says and Saul sinned against the will of God, Saul disobeyed God and he was not restored, because he didn’t repent. He asked Samuel to bless, he said bless me before the people, he was concerned with his public approval, he was concerned with his public image, but he never really repented towards God, and so he was not restored.</p>
<p>Another example we saw in the Bible was Judas and Peter. Now both were disciples of the Lord, both were apostles. And some people will quickly brush off this situation of Judas and say, well he was just never saved to begin with. But Jesus picked 12 men and it says to preach the gospel, heal the sick and to cast out devils. And he even said, Satan cannot cast out Satan. Well here Judas was chosen to be an apostle, chosen by Jesus himself to preach the gospel publicly and by doing so, I believe Jesus put his public approval upon this man. He was sending this man out to preach his message, made him an apostle, not an ordinary disciple but an apostle and by Jesus picking this man, he put his public approval upon him. I believe Judas had to have been a genuine follower of Christ when he was chosen. And there’s other man throughout history that have said the same thing, John Fletcher, Chrysostom, I think it was Ambrose who said the same, Judas when he was chosen by Jesus was genuine and sincere in his commitment to Christ. The fact that the Bible calls him a disciple at all, the Bible says you can’t be a disciple unless you leave all to follow Christ, and it says in Acts 1:25 that Judas fell from his apostleship by his transgression. So you see Judas was a genuine believer, who became a devil. Jesus said have I not chosen you and yet one of you is a devil. And he said one of you will betray me. So this man sinned, backslid in his heart. Now, it was contemplating, betraying the Lord and actually did betray the Lord and Jesus said it would have been better for him if he was never born. Which is a contrast to what Jesus previously said to his disciples, it says there is twelve thrones in heaven that you will sit upon to judge the nations. Judas was part of the disciples when Jesus said that there’s twelve thrones. So Judas had a throne. But now Jesus was saying it would have been better for him if he was never born at all. So you see, this man clearly fell from the faith, he lost his salvation, was again under the wrath of God and he didn’t repent towards God. He didn’t have godly sorrow, that led to repentance, he had worldly sorrow, which led to his death, suicide, but he never had genuine repentance. Now you contrast the apostle Judas the apostle Peter. Peter denied the Lord. Jesus predicted his denial, “you’ll deny me 3 times”, all of them forsook him, the shepherd would be struck and all the sheep would scatter. They denied the Lord, betrayed the Lord. Peter verbally denied ever knowing Christ and yet Peter was restored. It says Peter genuinely repented, Jesus asked him 3 times „do you love me“, because he had denied him 3 times. So 3 times he asked him “do you love me?”, so there is this process of restoration Jesus had with Peter who genuinely repented of his sin, of his betrayal and was reconciled back to God. Now if Peter had died in his sin; Jesus even said, if you deny me before men, I will deny you before my father in heaven and before his holy angels. So if Peter had died in his sin, he wouldn’t have gone to heaven, he wouldn’t have been a friend of God, he would have been denied by God, if he had died in his sin. But he repented and he was therefore restored.</p>
<p><strong>What If a Believer Sins – Part 4 (<a href="http://gesundelehre.tk/?feed-stats-url=aHR0cDovL3lvdXR1LmJlL0I3MFZnbld2WWdZ&feed-stats-url-post-id=1">http://youtu.be/B70VgnWvYgY</a>)</strong></p>
<p>So I would say that people ask, well where is the security, where is this, and they want eternal security. There is security in Christ, but there’s no security in sin. Jesus said, you can’t serve two masters. You need to choose one or the other. We’re either choosing to live for God or we’re choosing to live for ourself and live for sin. And if we’re living in sin, walking in sin, there’s no security. God has never promised mercy and forgiveness to those who continue in their sins. God has only promised mercy and forgiveness to those who give up their sins. He says “let the wicked forsake his way”, “Whoever confesses and forsakes his sin will find mercy”. Well God promises those who continue in their sin condemnation, his wrath, judgment, hell, that’s the only thing God promises those who continue in their sins. So, God offers us salvation, he offers us security, but we must abide in him, continue in him, walk in the light as he is in the light. Because if we walk in darkness, we don’t have fellowship with him. And the Bible says, by this we know that we know him if we keep his commandments. The book of Hebrews says, he became the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him. There’s no salvation for those who are disobeying him. It says he’s the author of eternal salvation to all them that obey him. The Bible says, sin separates us from God. That’s why he who says I know him and keeps not his commandments is a liar, the truth is not in us.</p>
<p>You can’t be a friend of God, while you are at war with him at the same time. You can’t be reconciled to God, while you’re in rebellion towards God. You can’t have both at the same time. You need to choose one or the other.</p>
<p>So, if a believer sins he must repent. And what is repentance? What is sin? It says in 1. John “Sin is transgression of the law”. Repentance in the Greek means change of mind, so to repent of your sin means that you change your mind about sinning you change your mind about breaking Gods law. You no longer have a disobedient heart, you no longer have a rebellious heart, you change your mind about living selfish and wicked. You make up your mind to live a life of holiness, that would glorify God and be pleasing to God, to bring honor and glory. The Bible says worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness, give unto the Lord the honor that’s due his name. So to repent means, change your mind about breaking Gods law. Now were not saved by obeying the law. NO amount of obedience can ever atone for disobedience. The only thing that can atone for sin is the blood of Christ. The only thing that can cover our sin is the blood of Christ. The Bible says in Hebrews 10,26 “If we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there’s no more sacrifice for sins”. So while the only thing that atones for our sin is the blood of Christ, his blood does not cover us in our willful and present disobedience. We have to give up our sins. So we’re not saved by obeying the law, we’re condemned if we break the law. And we need to change our mind about breaking the law, the moral law of God, the 2 great commandments. We need to change our mind about breaking Gods law if we want him to pardon us, to forgive us, to have mercy upon us.</p>
<p>So the message is quite simple, is that if we sin we shouldn’t comfort ourselves with these false comforts, that it’s ok, that God doesn’t see it or that it’s already taken care of, we don’t need to repent or any of these other types of things, that men try to comfort themselves with. But if we find ourselves in sin of any kind, and conscious rebellion against God, we simply need to repent and be restored. God in his great mercy and goodness is eager and willing to forgive those who repent. Because the Bible says God is not willing that any should perish, that all should come to repentance. God does not delight in the death of the wicked, but that they would turn and live.</p>
<p>So that’s the message. So let’s just pray and seek the Lord. Father, I just pray that your truth will always encourage us towards life of holiness. Lord, as we know the Bible talks about doctrine that’s according to godliness, the truth that’s after godliness. I just pray that we’ll, never in our hearts or in our minds, hold on to doctrines or believes that make us comfortable in sin. That Lord, that your word will convict us, if we find ourselves falling short of your will, we find ourselves in sin and wickedness Lord, that your truth will set us free from sin. The Bible says you’ll know the truth and the truth will set us free. Oh Lord, so that we’ll never be comfortable unless we’re right with you, that we’ll never be satisfied unless we’re right with you, that by your grace you’ll keep us in your will by your grace, you’ll help us in a walk of holiness Lord. That we’ll be separate from the world, that we’ll be separate from sin. The Bible says blessed are those who keep your commandments that they might enter through the gate and have access to the tree of life. Lord that we’ll be found on that day faultless and blameless at your coming, that we’ll do those things that are pleasing in your sight. We pray in Jesus’ name, AMEN.</p>
