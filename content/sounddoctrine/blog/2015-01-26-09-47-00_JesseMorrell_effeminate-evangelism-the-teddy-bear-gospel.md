<p>In the book of acts chapter 4 verse 31, it says, that when the holy Ghost came upon them, they began to preach the word of God with boldness. Preaching the word with fire, with passion and with boldness is really a fruit of the spirit. It’s a gift of the spirit. Holy fire and boldness is an evidence of being baptized with the holy Ghost. You show me a preacher, that is too afraid, to confront sin, that is soft and not bold in his proclamation and I’ll show you a preacher, that’s not full of the holy Ghost. And there’s a lot of preaching today in the church and in the world, that is certainly anything but bold. Very soft on sin. There is what I would call the namby-pamby-soft-sentimental-teddybear-in-the-sky type of a Gospel today, where God is preached to people not as the Lord, not as a judge, but as your homeboy or just as a teddy bear, as a type of Santa Claus, that is joyful and jolly and certainly anything but angry with the wicked.</p>
<p>I’ve seen churches with kiosks that say “God’s not mad at you, no matter what”. And so there’s this soft-boy-sissy-Gospel being preached today that God’s not mad at you, God accepts you as you are. Where the word of God is not boldly declared. And my ministry has always been very bold. We go out into the open air, to the streets and we stand up and proclaim the Gospel and proclaim the word of God in it’s entirety, the full counsel of Gods word, we preach Gods wrath and Gods mercy. We preach Gods judgment and Gods forgiveness. And when I’m out in the open air, boldly confronting sin and warning them about the judgment of God, sinners and even compromised Christians will often tell me, you’re turning people off. Your bold approach, your confrontational approach – it’s turning people off. The fact of the matter is, the Bible says “the light has come into the world and the world loved darkness rather than light”. Jesus said that the world will hate you. If your evangelism methods never provoke the wrath of the world, the anger of the world or persecution from the world – then you’re not doing it right. A servant is not greater than his master. If you’re accepted by this world, that takes the name of the Lord in vain, uses his name as a curse word and yet they clap for your sermon, than something is terribly wrong with your method.</p>
<p>When I stand up and preach about the wrath of God, the judgment of God, the anger of God, and paving a way for the preaching of the mercy of God and forgiveness of God, usually I have these compromised Christians, so called, who will interrupt my preaching and stand up, trying to steal the crowd and say “this guy, he’s doing it wrong, this guy is preaching false, I’m going to give you the real Gospel” – “God loves you, God’s not mad at you, God accepts you as you are”. And the result is that the crowd will clap for him, they cheer for him. They’ll tell me “hey buddy, we like this guy, we don’t like you, nobody wants to hear you, we like what this guy has to say”. And just like the false prophets in the old testament they speak smooth things and they say peace, peace, when there is no peace. And so if your method and your message results in the approval of the world, then you’re not being Christ-like you are not being godly.</p>
<p>Before I came to Christ, I was living in wickedness and sin, drugs, alcohol, crime, violence, I was as lost and as sinful as you can imagine. And back then, during my sinner days in high school there were Christians, who would try and witness to me. You see, in class I would boast about spending the weekend in jail or some fight that I got into or some crime I committed. I was always boasting on my pals, my friends, and sometimes, Christians would overhear these conversations and after class in the hallway, I had people that would come up to me and say “you know, Jesse I just felt like I wanted, I needed to tell you something” and with very soft voice, they would say “God, he loves you and he wants to have a personal relationship with you”. And when these Christians said “you know, God loves you, God wants to have a personal relationship with you”, my thought was, these people are kind of strange, they’re kind of creepy, all this emotionalism and love and relationship, it just really turned me off, it just seemed soft and wimpy and weak and girly and so this effeminate evangelism really turned me off. It was so soft, so weak, so wimpy, it really as a sinner, turned me off to what they had to say.</p>
<p>Now – I certainly believe in preaching about the love of God, but today, the love of God is preached exclusively by some of these what I would call the love people, the love group. All they want to talk about is Gods love. All they want to preach about is Gods mercy. And certainly I preach the love of God, I preach the mercy of God, I preach a relationship with God, but not exclusively isolating the gospel on these, what you would call just mere positive points, when the Bible all throughout the Bible preaches about sin and hell and judgment and so a preacher of the Bible by definition needs to preach the Bible. Not just the chapters or verses about Gods love, but the verses about Gods judgment and wrath.</p>
<p>And so while this namby-pamby-teddybear-Gospel really turned me off, praise God, when I was locked up, I heard a hellfire-preacher, who preached about sin and hell and judgment. He convicted my heart, it woke me up, when it was presented as a matter of life and death, heaven or hell; that I was actually angering God, and that I was putting my soul in hell, that woke me up. And shortly thereafter became a radically saved born-again, turned from a life of sin to a life of holiness, from serving self to serving Christ. And if it wasn’t for bold preaching about sin, hell and judgment – I don’t think my conscience would have ever woken up. I don’t think I ever would have come to Christ at all, and so we need bold, confrontational preaching in our society today. If you look at the evangelism of the prophets, of Jesus Christ, of the apostles you’ll see that they weren’t just namby-pamby-soft-boy-sissies going around telling everybody “oh God loves you…, God loves you…”. They were fire and brimstone preachers. In fact, the phrase hellfire was coined by Jesus Christ himself. You’ll see, that the prophets rebuked sinners at the gate and confronted the sin of society with holy boldness, love was not the only thing they preached about.</p>
<p>John 3,16 has been preached loud and clear from every pulpit all throughout the United States, been broadcasted through the radio, through Crusades. But it is interesting that John 3,16 when it was originally preached by Jesus Christ, was preached to one man named Nikodemus, at nighttime, in secret. John 3,16 is not what Jesus Christ preached to the general masses. When you go to the sermon on the mount, which was Jesus’ open air message to the general masses, he preached again about sin, about hell and about judgment – not once in the entire sermon did he mention Gods love for the sinner. And we see the apostles in the book of acts, boldly confronting those who put Jesus to death, and calling out there sin and Steven, who boldly rebuked the audience that he had listening to him in the open air for being stiff-necked and hardhearted and always resisting the holy Ghost. We see John the Baptist, who publicly confronted king Herod for being an adulterer and so we see bold, fiery preaching, confrontational evangelism against sin. You don’t see the apostles and the prophets being soft-boy-sissies practicing what I call effeminate evangelism.</p>
<p>But the way that you’ve seen it done today in a lot of evangelism groups is that “Gods love is exclusively what we preach” and “if you’re not exclusively preaching the love of God, then you’re not preaching the Gospel”. And really, they have this false understanding of the Gospel, a false understanding of the way Jesus witnessed – Jesus didn’t just hang out with sinners, with his long hair flowing and putting his arms around them, singing Cumbaya as they drank beer at the bar. Jesus said at the sermon on the mount, if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off, if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out – it’s better for you to go through life without a hand or without an eye, than to be cast into hell with both. You see, that was Jesus’ message to the general masses, and so our message ought to be one of sin, hell and judgment.</p>
<p>The Bible says, he has ordained us to preach that Jesus Christ is the judge of the living and the dead and that God will judge the secrets of mens hearts according to my Gospel. You see, judgment is a necessary part of the Gospel message, because judgment paves the way for Gods forgiveness. It’s in light of how we deserve his judgment that we see how much we are in need of his mercy. It’s in light of how much we deserve his wrath, that we see how much we need his grace. It’s in light of how much we deserve damnation, that we see how much we are in need of salvation. And so the Gospel preacher needs to preach about sin, hell, judgment, fire and damnation in order to pave the way for a proper understanding of Gods grace, mercy, forgiveness and loving kindness in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>You know, our Gospel tracts, they don’t need to be like Valentine Day Cards with the eyes dotted with little red hearts. Our method of evangelism doesn’t have to be soft or emotionalism, isolating certain truths of the Bible that are maybe more acceptable to this sinful world. Our evangelism methods ought to be bold, if we’re led of the Holy Spirit, it will be bold. Our evangelism methods don’t have to be soft, they can be bold. We can be bold for the Lord. And as Jesus and the Apostles and the Prophets were confrontational toward sin, we ought to be confrontational towards sin. And so in essence, don’t be a sissy for Jesus. Don’t practice what I call effeminate evangelism. Don’t just go around, telling people “God loves you, God loves you”. Tell them, what the Bible says. Tell them that God is angry with you, God is angry with the wicked every day. Your sin is going to put you in hell. You’re angering God. You’re provoking God to wrath, you deserve the judgment of God. And that’s why you need the mercy of God. That’s why you need to beg him for grace. That’s why you need his forgiveness, through Jesus Christ. Don’t go around, telling people, “Oh, God loves you, just as you are, you don’t need to change”. Tell them you need to be born again, you need to repent or perish. God is angry with the wicked every day. In fact the Bible says God hates all workers of iniquity. Your sin makes you the enemy of God. Your sin puts you at enmity with your Lord. You need to be reconciled through the blood of Jesus Christ. Godly men, men of God, don’t have to be girly men, you can be a man of God like Elijah, who even mocked the false prophets, and be like Jesus Christ who confronted the compromise of the temple even made a whip and cast out the money changers. You see, you can be a man of God, who’s (you’re) not effeminate, but masculine, bold, confrontational, even dangerous.</p>
<p>My encouragement for you today, go out and find a street corner, a busy street corner and boldly lift up your voice for Jesus confront our society for its wickedness, confront our society with its sin and call them to repentance. Warn them about Gods judgment, warn them about damnation. Warn them about hell, and call them to Jesus Christ for the salvation of their souls.</p>
