<p>Okay, I want to talk to you today about the grace of God. I believe the grace of God is one of the most misunderstood topics in the church and in the world today. Many people think that because of the grace of God, we can just live in sin and be saved. That you know, as believers, we can sin every day in word, thought and deed and still be saved, because we are covered by the grace of God.</p>
<p>Now, most people have a understanding of grace, from, you know, say Ephesians 2:8 and 9 – and it says “for by grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourselves its a gift of God, not of works lest any man should boast”. And so here the Bible portrays grace as a unmerited favor and it most certainly is, the forgiveness of sin is unmerited.</p>
<p>But many people seem to stop short at the full understanding of the grace of God. It’s more than just unmerited favor in forgiveness. If you go to, say Thayer’s Greek New Testament Lexicon, it will define grace as the “divine influence upon the heart”. And so grace is more than just an unmerited favor, grace is a divine influence upon our heart, it influences our will, it effects our choices.</p>
<p>The true test, the true proof of the grace of God in your life, is that you are living a holy life. In fact if you go to Titus 2:11 it says, “For the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men, teaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lust, we should life righteously, godly and sober in this present world”. And so here grace is portrayed as a teacher. Grace teaches us to live righteous, grace teaches us to live holy. And in this way, grace is an influence. That’s why Paul said in Romans chapter 6, that “sin shall not have dominion over you, for you are not under law, but under grace”. And so we see, when you’re under the mere influence of law, sin still has dominion over you. If you’re only under the influence of law, then you’re going to have a Romans-chapter-7-experience. But when you experience the grace of God, you come under the influence of his grace, it liberates you from sin, sets you free from sin, and you begin to live a holy life.</p>
<p>We also see in Jude – you know, Jude wrote that many will come, these false teachers, who bring upon themselves swift destruction – and it says they’re going to teach the grace of God or turn the grace of God into lasciviousness. In other words they’re going to turn the grace of God into a license to sin. And that’s what we’re seeing in todays church. People think, that grace means you can live wicked and you can live unholy, you can break the law of God and still be saved, because you’re not saved by works, you’re not saved by the law, you’re saved by grace.</p>
<p>But that’s a misunderstanding and a perversion of the grace of God. It’s not a license of sin, it’s a influence, a teacher, a gracious, divine influence upon the heart for us to turn from our sins and to commit ourselves to Christ and to live holy and obedient to him.</p>
