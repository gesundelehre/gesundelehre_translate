<p>When we say that it is possible to live a life free of sin, as Jesus commands, the cry is that we are teaching “sinless perfectionism”. What is ironic is that these people who cry this false charge do not discern that they are teaching the very thing they condemn!</p>
<p>They make the false assumption that when a soul is converted, he will NEVER, ever sin again. After convincing you of this false assumption, they then try to disprove the claim, which we never made in the first place! Then they will quote such passages as Heb. 12:6. They like the “chastise” passage, for this is their ‘proof’ that if a child of God never sins after being born again, then they can’t be chastised. They like to talk about sin, being saved in sin, stay in sin, and defend sin. They hope that you, the reader, will fall for their assumptions, and then try to convince you that you can’t be anything but a low down sinner for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>Now, let’s see who is really teaching ‘sinless perfectionism’. By pronouncing condemnation on us (claiming what we do not teach), they reprobate themselves. According to them:</p>
<ol>
<li>When you ‘accept’ Jesus, you are justified (forgiven)</li>
<li>There was a magnificent transfer that took place, meaning Christ becomes your perfection because his ‘obedience’ was ‘transferred’ to you by faith.</li>
<li>Because of number 2, your past, present AND ‘future’ sins are all covered once and for all.</li>
<li>Because Jesus’ tract record is imputed to you, God is now blind to your conduct because of the blood of Christ. God can no longer see you who sins.</li>
<li>All this is ‘positional’, NEVER ‘practical’.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is interesting that Christ’s righteousness (“obedience imputed to you”, which the Bible does NOT teach) was magically transferred to you once you trusted in Him. You are now considered ‘sinless’ because all your past, present, and FUTURE sins are all forgiven. This means that your sins, even future ones you have not yet committed, can NEVER be charged against you no matter what your conduct afterwards.</p>
<p><strong>1.PROBLEM</strong></p>
<p>If this were true, THERE IS NO NEED FOR CHASTISEMENT! How can you be chastised over sins that the blood was supposed to have covered and God became morally blind to your conduct and future conduct when you accepted His Son? (See: Have you Resisted) If all your FUTURE sins are already forgiven, what purpose would there be in any type of correction since God does not see you anymore, just His Son Jesus? Remember? God can’t see you sinning, He only sees Jesus! How can they accuse us of teaching ‘sinless perfectionism” since Christ is their PROXY? Does their teaching not EQUATE TO SINLESS</p>
<p>PERFECTION? Isn’t this calling the kettle black?</p>
<p>These people teach that you sin every day in thought, word, and deed! They even go so far to say that temptation is sin to make sure you get it – that you were saved from nothing. What they are really telling you is that sinning is proof that you are saved and in the faith! How ludicrous! This kind of Gospel is nothing but a hoax coming from frauds and liars.</p>
<p>Let’s clear some things up. Those who believe we can live holy lives, as God commands, have never said:</p>
<ol>
<li>That a Christian never sinned in his life time (“For all have sinned”)</li>
<li>That a Christian doesn’t have the ability to sin after he is saved.</li>
<li>And that once a person is converted that he will be forced not to sin.</li>
</ol>
<p>What is taught is that a person cannot have salvation without repentance (forsaking all sins). 2 Cor. 7:10-11.</p>
<p>Scripture also says,</p>
<p>“No one who abides in him [Jesus] keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.” 1 John 3:6</p>
<p>We are also told how we can know who is a child of God and who is a child of the devil.</p>
<p>“In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God, neither he that loveth not his brother.” 1 John 3:10</p>
<p>A ‘saint’ is characterized by walking a life of holiness. A ‘child of the devil’ is characterized by walking a life of sin.</p>
<p>IF a child of God should give into temptation and act upon it (sin), God’s word tells us we have an Advocate with the Father (1 John 2:1). Notice it says IF. Sinning is not a foregone conclusion in John’s mind, nor was it in Jesus’ mind as well. (“Go and sin no more”). Paul says, “Awake to righteousness and sin not.”</p>
<p><strong>2.PROBLEM</strong></p>
<p>NOWHERE is Jesus said to be our PROXY. Where it concerns righteousness, we are told NOT TO BE DECEIVED in this matter.</p>
<p>“Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth righteousness is righteous, even as he [Jesus] is righteous.” 1 John 3:7</p>
<p>So much for the fake proxy. One is considered righteous WHEN he does what is right, and when he does, he is considered righteous as Jesus is righteous. There was no magical transfer that took place.</p>
<p>The false gospel preached today is missing the element of REPENTANCE. Jesus told the disciples to preach REPENTANCE. Some would go so far to say that repentance is not part of the gospel! Jesus said,</p>
<p>“And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among ALL nations, beginning at Jerusalem.” Luke 24:47</p>
<p>Repentance is commanded by God to ALL men everywhere. (Acts 5:31; 11:18; 17:30-31; 20:21; 26:20; Rom. 2:4; 2 Tim. 2:25; 2 Pet. 3:9). (Repentance is NOT an apology for being sinful, nor being born with a ‘sinful nature,’ as they falsely teach!) What is repentance? Repentance is to sweep, scrape, scrub and cast out of doors all defilement of the heart IN ORDER to make it clean for the reception of the holy Spirit. (Matt. 12:43-45; Lk. 11:24-26; Acts 5:32). The holy Spirit is only given to those who obey Him (Acts 5:32), not to those who continue in sin and hope God cleans them up later (as some suggest), which later never seems to come about until the day of physical death! Repentance can take a process of time (a season of “godly sorrow” until there is full repentance) or instantaneously. Repentance is not sorrow alone, it also involves a change of mind, inclinations and desires, which translates into a total change in character and conduct. (Mt. 3:8; Mk. 4:12; Lk. 8:15; Jn. 8:34; 8:36; Lk. 19:1-10; Acts 26:20; 2 Cor. 6:1; 5:17; 1 Thess. 1:9; 2 Tim. 2:19; Titus 2:11-12).</p>
<p>Repentance that is genuine is initiated by God through a crisis of conviction leading to a season of godly sorrow for sin. (Jn. 16:8; Acts 2:37; 4:8-10; 5:31; 11:18; 2 Cor. 7:10). Biblical repentance from Genesis to Revelation is to “forsake” our wickedness, “purge” our heart of evil and SEEK the mercy of God. (Isa. 55:7; Jer. 26:13; Pro. 28:13; Jon. 3:8-10; Matt. 12:41; Lk. 15:11-32; Acts 3:19; 2 Cor. 7:10-11; 2 Tim. 2:19; Jas. 3:7-10; 1 Pet. 4:1; Rev. 2:5; 2:16; 2:20-22; 3:3; 3:19)!</p>
<p>To dismiss repentance as not part of the gospel is very serious, for it nullifies reconciliation with God, and thus no conversion and no forgiveness. (Lk. 13:3; 24:47; Mk. 4:12; Acts 3:19; 2 Cor. 7:10).</p>
<p>True repentance is a condition for salvation. (Mk. 1:15; Lk. 13:3; Acts 5:31; 11:18; 17:30; 20:21; Rom. 2:4; 2 Cor. 7:10; 2 Pet. 3:9).</p>
<p>We don’t teach “sinless perfectionism,” we simply say that one is able and must obey God from his heart. </p>
