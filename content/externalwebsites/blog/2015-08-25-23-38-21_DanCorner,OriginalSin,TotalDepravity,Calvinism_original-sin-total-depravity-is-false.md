## The Bible Truth About _Original Sin_

**The Calvinistic concept of Total Depravity (_original sin_) is _not_ Scriptural. Babies and little children are _alive_ spiritually, in contrast to the false belief in _original sin. All_** babies who die go into the presence of God and not hell, unlike what [**<u>Calvinism</u>**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.html) teaches. (Calvinism teaches only elect babies who die escape damnation!) **There is an _age of accountability,_** which is implied in Scripture, but it is not a set age.


## People Are Not Born _Sinners_

People are not born _sinners_. **Though it is not perfectly clear, there is a time period when a baby or very young person is protected from eternal damnation because of his own sins. That is when he becomes a _sinner._**

![original sin](../../files/pictures/original-sin.jpg "original sin") 

Why? Because their unbelief in Jesus and rebellion would not be _sin_ for them. If not true, then innocent babies and little children would all, with no exception, be damned to fiery torment upon their early premature death, which is unthinkable of the God of the Bible. Most importantly, here is specific Scriptural support:

> Once I was alive apart from law; but **when the commandment came, sin sprang to life and I died.** I found that the very commandment that was intended to bring life actually brought death. For sin, seizing the opportunity afforded by the commandment, deceived me, and through the commandment put me to death. (Rom 7:9-11)



## Age Of Accountability

Every person is different regarding that age. That mysterious _age of accountability_ would be different for each person, based on their personal _knowledge:_

> Anyone, then, who **knows** the good he ought to do and doesn’t do it, sins. (James 4:17)

All young children lack _knowledge_ about right and wrong:

> But **before the boy knows enough** to reject the wrong and choose the right, the land of the two kings you dread will be laid waste. (Isa 7:16)

This mysterious _age of accountability_ does exist and the Calvinistic doctrine of _infant damnation_ for the non-elect is shown to be preposterous and out of harmony to the rest of Scriptures, just like all five points of [**Calvinism**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinism.htm). The Calvinistic false concept of God could shockingly allow him to send innocent babies to be tormented in fire forever!


## The Inventor of _Original Sin_

The inventor of the doctrine of _original sin_ was [**<u>Augustine</u>**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/augustineprayer.htm), the Catholic and Calvinist theologian. _Original sin_ refers to the adverse spiritual effect Adam’s disobedience had on his ancestors (the whole human race, except Mary)! That led to another false teaching labeled the [**_<u>immaculate conception</u>_**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/immaculatemary.htm), which refers to Mary, not Jesus, like some have been taught! Also, _infant baptism_ is supposed to wash away _original sin_, according to Augustine, from whom [**<u>John Calvin</u>**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/michael-servetus.html) got his doctrines. (In other words, Augustine thought babies would be regenerated through infant baptism, which is believed in our day by Catholics, Lutherans, Episcopals and others.)


## Original Sin Doctrine is a Tiny Problem

**Moreover, while _original sin_ is false, it is never shown to be a problem in the New Testament like a grace teaching distorted into a license to sin (Jude 3,4; 2 Peter 2), the essence of _eternal security._**There is one whole book (plus) of the Bible written about those who change  **_grace_** into a license for immorality. Please read the  [**_<u>acid test</u>_**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/acid_test.html) to identify any license for immorality teacher. **To magnify a tiny issue as _original sin_ as the major problem is to have a warped theology and be in error. Sadly, such seems commonplace among Charles Finney devotees. Folks, [Charles Finney](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/charles-finney.html) was not infallible! Don't allow him to be your _pope_ figure. Draw your doctrines from the Bible alone.**

**The truth is, all five points of Calvinism are demonic, but some are much worse than others.** The most sinister point, by far, is **eternal security (once saved always saved or the perseverance of the saints).** That means **the Calvinistic and [<u>Catholic</u>](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.html) doctrine of _original sin_ can _not_ compare with the danger inherent within [<u>once saved always saved</u>](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** as some actually teach! Also, Christians are specifically commanded to contend against a _license for immorality_ (Jude 3,4).

**_Once saved always saved_ is the monster heresy of our day in Bible believing circles, adversely affecting untold millions of precious eternal souls in various ways. It is boldly taught as grace, the gospel, foundational to Christianity and the atonement by the most popular preachers in our day such as Charles Stanley compared to almost no one trying to push original sin in that same way!** Eternal security must be [<u>**opposed by Christians and _not tolerated_**</u>](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-treason.htm), as is often done. The first point of Calvinism (and the related _original sin)_ is so tiny and insignificant compared to the last point—it’s like comparing the proverbial _mole hill to a mountain._ Furthermore, one can preach the real gospel without opposing or even mentioning _original sin,_ which is shown repeatedly in Acts when the gospel was preached. Moreover, a [**<u>Christian is not a sinner</u>**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/christiansinner.htm) A Christian is a _righteous_ person who is following Jesus ([**John 10:27**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/john1028.html); Heb. 5:9) and putting into practice God's word (Luke 8:21; Mt. 7:21; etc.). **It should be clear that the Bible does not teach _original sin_ or the related [infant baptism](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/infantbaptism.htm) or [<u>baptismal regeneration</u>](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://evangelicaloutreach.org/baptism.html).**
