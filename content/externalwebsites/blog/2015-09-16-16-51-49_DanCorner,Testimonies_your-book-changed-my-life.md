# Your Book Changed My Life

### Eric

... it’s been quite some time since I’ve written you (about 2 years or so). I just wanted to send you a quick note to say I love you. I love your ministry. **I deeply respect your concern for the spiritual safety, well-being, and maturation of Christians.** You provided me a free copy of your book, "[The Believer’s Conditional Security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dan-corner-the-believers-conditional-security.html)" several years ago, and **it changed my life**. At that time in my life, I had many financial struggles, and you showed me love and compassion by sending me that book at your expense. I am extremely thankful for the love you have shown me. Please keep up the good work and stay strong. **Many people will try and oppose you because you teach such a frightening message. But I believe God will reward your faithfulness and unrelenting dedication to truth.** I just listened to your audio message about Hell... and it scared me to death. It is supposed to scare me because it is utterly and completely true. "It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the Living God." That message gave me a much needed wake up call.. and encouraged me to keep in mind the spiritual destiny of most people. This creates a burden within me to "snatch others from the fire." I have much to say to you... but realize you probably have more mail than you could possibly read... so I end with this: KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK! I LOVE YOU AND YOUR MINISTRY! [emphasis his]
