## My Sin Blinded Me From The Truth Of A Conditional Security

[![southern baptist](../../files/pictures/sins-blinded-me-from-seeing-the-truth.jpg "I was deceived because of SIN.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html)

I initially thought I was saved on September 1st 1979\. I heard a gospel message and I believed it and experienced an emotional reaction as well as displayed a change in direction. **One thing didn't occur though. I remained in my sin.

November of 2009, while chatting with my friend ___________ on Facebook I was confronted with this question from him; he said, _**brother Tim do you believe in holiness unto the Lord?_ ** My reply was _YES I do._ He then asked me the question**_; brother Tim do you walk in holiness unto the Lord?_ The reality of the opposite hit me like a car at high speed. I didn't want to lie so I told him that I needed to get off line and I would talk with him at another time. **The Lord was dealing with me and I was under conviction. No one could see me there in front of the computer except for the Lord. I began to repent there and cry out for forgiveness and my eyes began to be opened for the first time. I determined right there that I am turning from every known sin in my life and walk in circumspect holiness unto the Lord.

I had debated the doctrine of [_conditional security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)_ _for nearly 30 years and now the Lord was showing me what the scriptures really said because **I was not able to see this truth before I turned from my sins. Since that eye opening event occurred **I have lost most of my friends and my siblings have written me off. **I've had to confront an entire congregation of their error and I have received threats on my life in exchange. All of these things happened and I have the most perfect peace about them.
