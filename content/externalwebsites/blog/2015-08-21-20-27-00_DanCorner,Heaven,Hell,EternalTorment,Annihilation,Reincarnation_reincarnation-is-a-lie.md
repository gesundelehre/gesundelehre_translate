## The Bible Proves Reincarnation Is A Lie

[![reincarnation lie](../../files/pictures/reincarnation-lie.jpg "Reincarnation is a lie")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)

The only way we can correctly learn about the afterlife, including the subject of _reincarnation_, is to consult the Bible. It alone is the only source inspired by **[Almighty God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.html).** No other book is the proven word of God, though such claims have been made about the following: **[Book of Mormon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon-1.html),** Quran (Koran), Bhagavad-Gita, Avesta, Angas, etc. When the evidence is examined, the findings show **reincarnation is a lie.**

The **[Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)** is proven as the **[word of God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wordgod.html)** by the fulfillment of Bible prophesies. It is mathematically impossible for all of these prophesies to have just happened by chance. This proves that the people who wrote the Bible were inspired by God, for only God could accurately foretell the future, in detail 100% of the time, and at the same time encourage mankind to obey Him. So what does the Biblical record reveal?

**Heb. 9:27 reads:**

> "And as it is appointed for men **to die once**, but after this the judgment."

That clearly proves there is no reincarnation after our death for we will die only once. But there are other clear passages that prove the same:

> "For when a few years are finished, I shall go the way of **no return**." (Job 16:22 NKJV)

> "He remembered that they were but flesh, **a passing breeze that does not return**" (Psa. 78:39, NIV).


## Resurrection, Not Reincarnation

The Bible teaches a **resurrection** not a reincarnation like the Hindus, New Agers and many others wrongly believe:

> "Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth **will awake: some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt**" (Dan. 12:2, NIV).

> "For I know _that_ my Redeemer lives, And He shall stand at last on the earth; And after my skin is destroyed, this _I know_, That **in my flesh I shall see God**" (Job 19:25,26, NKJV).

> "Do not be amazed at this, for **a time is coming when all who are in their graves will hear his voice and come out--those who have done good will rise to live, and those who have done evil will rise to be condemned**" (John 5:28,29, NIV).

> "But this I confess to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the Law and in the Prophets. I have hope in God, which they themselves also accept, that **there will be a resurrection of _the_ dead, both of _the_ just and _the_ unjust**. This _being_ so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense toward God and men" (Acts 24:14-16, NKJV).

> "**To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.** But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and follow evil, **there will be wrath and anger. There will be trouble and distress for every human being who does evil**" (Rom. 2:7-9, NIV).

This life now is often referred to in the Scriptures with the following phrase, "**the land of the living**":

> "Man does not know its [wisdom's] value, Nor is it found in **the land of the living**" (Job 28:13, NKJV).

> "I cried out to You, O LORD: I said, "You _are_ my refuge, My portion in **the land of the living**" (Psa. 142:5, NKJV).

Many other verses describe this life now in the same way (Psa. 27:13; 52:5; 116:9; Isa. 38:11; etc.).

## What Happens At Death?

**What will happen to you at the point of your physical death? How is this event described in the Bible; and most importantly, how can you prepare to meet God?**

"**The way of all the earth**" is a phrase used in Scripture referring to **physical death**. It, thereby, suggests that we will all die:

> "Now I am about to go **the way of all the earth**. You know with all your heart and soul that not one of all the good promises the LORD your God gave you has failed. Every promise has been fulfilled; not one has failed" (Joshua 23:14, NIV).

> "I am about to go **the way of all the earth**," he said. "So be strong, show yourself a man" (1 Kings 2:2, NIV).

## [There Was NO Reincarnation For The Rich Man Who Died!](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/luke16.htm)


## The Spirit Departs At Death

The point of physical death is know as a "**departure**" (Lk. 9:31; 2 Tim. 4:6; 2 Pet. 1:15). That is, **it is the point in time that one's spirit _departs_ from their physical body:**

> "For as **the body without the spirit is dead**, so faith without works is dead also" (James 2:26, NKJV).

When the Lord Jesus raised a girl from the dead, her spirit returned to her physical body:

> "And they ridiculed Him, knowing that **she was dead**. But He put them all outside, took her by the hand and called, saying, 'Little girl, arise.' Then **her spirit returned**, and she arose immediately" (Lk. 8:53-55, NKJV).

The Apostles Paul and Peter wrote of their own _departure:_

> "For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my **departure** is at hand. I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith" (2 Tim. 4:6,7, NKJV).

> "And I will make every effort to see that after my **departure** you will always be able to remember these things" (2 Pet. 1:15, NIV).

**Our own _departure_ is one year closer now than it was this same time last year. Death is like taking a trip. For the righteous, we will go _home_ to be with the Lord:**

> "Therefore we are always confident and know that as long as we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord. We live by faith, not by sight. We are confident, I say, and would prefer to be away from the body and **at home with the Lord**. So we make it our goal to please him, whether we are at home in the body or away from it. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive what is due him for the things done while in the body, whether good or bad" (2 Cor. 5:6-10).

**So our spirit departs to go home to be with the Lord, that is, if we are a Christian at death.**

On the other hand, to die is _loss_ for ALL Biblically unsaved people! It is only "gain" and "better by far" (Phil. 1:21-23) for those who are _living for Christ_. If this doesn't describe you, change now while you still have opportunity. **Turn from your [sins](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html) and trust in Jesus 100% for your soul's salvation** (Acts 20:21; 26:20).

I've heard people say of a person who suffered much because of a physical ailment before their death that _"They are better off now."_ But this is true **only if they were saved at the point of their death! If they weren't, they are in a worse condition in eternal fire!**


## Man's Life Now

**Mankind in general**, according to Scripture, is described in the following way:

> "Man born of woman is of **few days and full of trouble**. He springs up like a flower and withers away; like a fleeting shadow, **he does not endure**" (Job 14:1,2, NIV).

> "For, '**All men are LIKE GRASS, and all their glory is like the flowers of the field; the grass withers and the flowers fall**, but the word of the Lord stands forever.' And this is the word that was preached to you. **Therefore, rid yourselves of all malice and all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and slander of every kind**" (1 Pet. 1:24-2:1, NIV).

> "If God places no trust in his servants, if he charges his angels with error, how much more those who live in **houses of clay**, whose foundations are in the dust, who are **crushed more readily than a moth**!" (Job 4:18,19, NIV).

> "Stop trusting in man, who has but a **breath in his nostrils**. Of what account is he?" (Isa. 2:22, NIV).

Friend, one day you too will pass from "**the land of the living**" and go the "**way of all the earth**." After that **there will be no reincarnation for you**. Your soul and spirit, at the point of your physical death, will go either into the presence of God or into a place of punishment and pain depending upon your spiritual condition at that point in time. In the future, your body will arise to be thrown into the lake of fire (Mt. 13:41,42; Rev. 20:11-15) or be reunited with your spirit in the kingdom of God (1 Thess. 4:16,17; 1 Cor. 15:51-57 cf. Jn. 5:28,29)


## A Tunnel Experience?

**Also, please know that after physical death there is NO MENTION in the Bible of anyone GOING THROUGH A DARK TUNNEL, with a bright light on the other end and the sensation of great peace and love in the presence of this light, as in [NDEs](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/nde.html). The problem with this type of experience is atheists and other non-Christians testified to this type of experience, which clearly conflicts with the Word of God, the ONLY reliable source to consult to know the truth about what happens after death. The Scriptures DO NOT TESTIFY to a [universal salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/universalism.htm) for everyone, so don't believe it**. In fact, Jesus taught most will go to **[Hell](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html):**

> "Enter through the narrow gate. For wide is the gate and broad is the road that leads to **destruction, and many enter through it**. But small is the gate and **narrow the road that leads to life, and only a few find it**" (Mt. 7:13,14).


## Jesus Christ, Our Only Hope

The only hope you have beyond the grave to find peace, joy and contentment in eternity is found in **Jesus Christ** (Acts 4:12; John 14:6 cf. Rom. 2:7; Isa. 35:10; Rev. 21:4; etc.). Prepare for your own eternity by becoming **a Bible defined [Christian](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html) today**. Read and study the New Testament for yourself, so you won't be deceived by some sincere, well-meaning **[false teacher](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm),** who might even misuse the Bible! **Remember, it is only a trusting, submitting and enduring faith in Jesus that will get one an entrance into the kingdom of God.**

> "And the world is passing away, and the lust of it; but **he who does the will of God abides forever**" (1 John 2:17, NKJV).

> "But He answered and said to them, '**My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it**'" (Lk. 8:21, NKJV).

> "On no day will its gates ever be shut, for there will be no night there. The glory and honor of the nations will be brought into it. **Nothing impure will ever enter it, nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's book of life**" (Rev. 21:25-27).

> "**Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.** Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest **if we do not give up**. Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers" (Gal. 6:7-10).

Remember, **reincarnation** is a false teaching. **Jesus did not teach reincarnation.** Neither did Paul, John, James, etc. **Reincarnation has its roots in Hinduism and even some [alien ufo](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/aliens-and-religion.html) beliefs include _reincarnation!_**
