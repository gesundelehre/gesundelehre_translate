## Ellen G. White, Founder of The SDA Church

[![ellen g. white sda seven day adventist prophetess](../../files/pictures/warning-false-prophets-click.jpg "Ellen G. White, the Seven Day Adventist prophetess was a counterfeit and a heretic.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm)

**In Seventh-Day Adventist (SDA) circles, a vision that their _prophetess_ Ellen G. White (really a FALSE PROPHET) had in 1847 is very important to their exaltation of the _Sabbath_ command: (Ellen G. White is considered an _inspired prophetess_ among the SDA.)**

## Vision of Ellen G White, FALSE PROPHET

> We felt an unusual spirit of prayer. And as we prayed the Holy Ghost fell upon us. We were very happy. Soon I was lost to earthly things and was wrapped in a vision of God's glory. I saw an angel flying swiftly to me. **He quickly carried me from the earth to the Holy City. In the city I saw a temple,** which I entered. I passed through a door before I came to the first veil. This veil was raised, and I passed into the holy place. Here I saw the altar of incense, the candlestick with seven lamps, and the table on which was the shewbread. After viewing the glory of the holy, Jesus raised the second veil and I passed into the holy of holies.

> In the holiest I saw an ark; on the top and sides of it was purest gold. On each end of the ark was a lovely cherub, with its wings spread out over it. Their faces were turned toward each other, and they looked downward. Between the angels was a golden censer. Above the ark, where the angels stood, was an exceeding bright glory, that appeared like a throne where God dwelt. Jesus stood by the ark, and as the saints' prayers came up to Him, the incense in the censer would smoke, and He would offer up their prayers with the smoke of the incense to His Father. In the ark was the golden pot of manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of stone which folded together like a book. Jesus opened them, and I saw the ten commandments written on them with the finger of God. On one table were four, and on the other six. The four on the first table shone brighter than the other six. But the fourth, the Sabbath commandment, shone above them all; for **the Sabbath was set apart to be kept in honor of God's holy name. The holy Sabbath looked glorious -- a halo of glory was all around it.** I saw that the Sabbath commandment was not nailed to the cross. If it was, the other nine commandments were; and we are at liberty to break them all, as well as to break the fourth. I saw that God had not changed the Sabbath, for He never changes. But the pope had changed it from the seventh to the first day of the week; for he was to change times and laws ....

## [Six SHOCKING Facts For Saturday Sabbatarians To Ponder](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sabbath6facts.htm)

> I saw that the holy Sabbath is, and will be, **the separating wall between the true Israel of God and unbelievers;** and that the Sabbath is the great question to unite the hearts of God's dear, waiting saints (_Early Writings_, 1963, pp. 32,33).

The summary meaning of this Ellen G. White's vision is stated as follows:

> In this revelation, Mrs. White was carried down to the close of time and **saw the Sabbath as the great testing truth on which men decide whether to serve God or to serve an apostate power** (_Early Writings_, pp. 21,22).



## Ellen G White vs John Who Saw No Temple!

[![ellen g white mark of the beast](../../files/pictures/ellen-g-white-mark-of-the-beast.jpg "Ellen G. White was a DANGEROUS false prophet shown to be such even by her teachings on the mark of the beast.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sdamark.html)

Several important points need to be mentioned about this key Ellen G. White's vision: (1) She had this vision of the Holy City and stated that she saw a **temple** there. In contrast to this, the Apostle John saw the Holy City and stated that **it had no temple:**

> **I did not see a temple in the city,** because the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple (Rev. 21:22).

The Apostle John informs us that there is no temple in the Holy City, where Ellen G. White claims she saw one! Note: though we read of a "temple" in Revelation (7:15; 11:1; 11:19; 14:15,17; 15:5-8; 16:1,17) such is not found inside the Holy City, because the Apostle John said there was no need since the Lamb and God are its temple. Since there is no temple in the Holy City, according to Scripture, one must wonder: (1) Did Ellen G. White really have this vision? (2) If Ellen G. White did have the vision, it couldn't have been from the same spiritual source that John's vision was from, since the Apostle John said there was no need for a temple there. This single contradiction, centering around the temple in New Jerusalem, is enough to discredit Ellen G. White's whole prophetic ministry. This is true because **a true prophet can't contradict God's written word.** But there is even more to notice from that same vision. Ellen G. White stated in that same vision:

> ... the Sabbath was set apart to be **kept in honor of God's holy name**.

Again, Scripture declares something different about the Sabbath:

> **Remember** that you were slaves in Egypt and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. **Therefore the LORD your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day** (Deut. 5:15).

Scripture states the Sabbath command when given to Moses was a memorial for Israel to remember their deliverance from Egypt. It was not given _in honor of God's holy name._ Also, Ellen G White exalted the _Saturday Sabbath command_ to primary importance:

> I saw that the holy Sabbath is, and will be, **the separating wall between the true Israel of God and unbelievers; and that the Sabbath is the great question to unite the hearts of God's dear, waiting saints** (_Early Writings_, p. 33).



## Ellen G White's _Greatest_ Command

In a different vision, Ellen G. White stated that the _Sabbath_ is the **"greatest"** of the ten commandments:

> The pope has changed the day of rest from the seventh to the first day. He has thought to change the very commandment that was given to cause man to remember his Creator. He has thought to change **the greatest** commandment in the decalogue and thus make himself equal with God, or even exalt himself above God (_Early Writings_, p. 65).



## The Lord Jesus vs Ellen G White

In contrast, the Lord Jesus Himself tells us something different about the **"greatest"** commandment:

> "Teacher, which is **the greatest commandment** in the Law?" Jesus replied: "Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.' **This is the first and greatest commandment.** And the second is like it: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments (Mt. 22:36-40).

**When Jesus was asked the above question, it would have been the perfect time for the Him to state that the Sabbath command was the greatest command if it was. However, not only didn't He say that, the Lord clearly stated the (first and) greatest command was something else!** So again, in contrast to God's message, Ellen G. White has clearly declared something different. This is the exact opposite of how her prophetic visions are presented:

> ... Ellen White was given light that helped to explain their difficulty and open the way for the study to continue. **The visions also placed the stamp of God's approval upon correct conclusions. Thus the prophetic gift acted as a corrector of error and a confirmer of truth** (_Early Writings,_ pp. 23,24).



## Ellen G. White's and The Mark Of The Beast

According to Ellen G. White:

> The Sabbath will be the great test of loyalty, for it is the point of truth especially controverted. **When the final test shall be brought to bear upon men, then the line of distinction will be drawn between those who serve God and those who serve Him not.** While **the observance of the false Sabbath** in compliance with the law of the state, **contrary to the fourth commandment,** will be an avowal of allegiance to a power that is in opposition to God, the keeping of the true Sabbath, in obedience to God's law, is an evidence of loyalty to the Creator. **While one class, by accepting the sign of submission to earthly powers, receive the [**mark of the beast**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/markbeast.html), the other choosing the token of allegiance to divine authority, receive the seal of God** (_The Great Controversy,_ 1950, p. 605).

**In other words, Ellen G. White stated that ONLY Saturday Sabbatarians will not receive "the mark of the beast."** If you worship God on Sunday, like the early Christians did (Acts 20:7; 1 Cor.16:2), then you WILL receive the mark of the beast, according to Ellen G. White! The [**Bible states**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-beliefs.html) that such a time as when the mark of the beast will be issued will "call for patient endurance on the part of the saints who obey God's commandments and remain faithful to Jesus" (Rev. 14:12). The "commandments" mentioned in context with that verse especially point to fearing and worshiping God (v. 7).

The command to worship God implies that Christians who "remain faithful" to Jesus won't commit idolatry by worshiping the image of the Antichrist.



## Ellen G White's False Prophecy - _In A Few Months_

Ellen G. White also related what she says occurred on June 27, 1850:

> Some of us have had time to get the truth and to advance step by step, and every step we have taken has given us strength to take the next. But now **time is almost finished**, and what we have been years learning, they will have to learn **in a few months**. They will also have much to unlearn and much to learn again. Those who would not receive the mark of the beast and his image **when the decree goes forth**, must have now to say, Nay, we will not regard the institution of the beast (_Early Writings_, p.67).

Since much more than _a few months_ have gone by since 1850 and the decree to receive the mark of the beast has not been issued, we know **this was a definite false prophecy by Ellen G. White.** What does Scripture say about this?

> You may say to yourselves, "How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the LORD?" If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the LORD **does not take place or come true**, that is a message the LORD has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously. **Do not be afraid of him** (Deut. 18:21,22).



## Ellen G White, FALSE Prophet

**According to the Bible, Ellen G. White was, therefore, a false prophetess.** What did Jesus say about false prophets? He warned us to watch out for them for they are deceivers that have the appearance of a Christian:

> ... and many false prophets will appear and **deceive many** people (Mt. 24:11).

> **Watch out for false prophets.** They come to you **in sheep's clothing**, but inwardly they are ferocious wolves (Mt. 7:15).

Furthermore, God told Jeremiah the following about false prophets:

> Then the LORD said to me, "The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. **I have not sent them or appointed them or spoken to them. They are prophesying to you false visions, divinations, idolatries and the delusions of their own minds"** (Jer. 14:14).



## Ellen G White's Warning To Apostate Sabbathkeepers

**Sabbatarians are given a very solemn warning through a different Ellen G. White vision:**

> Then I was shown **a company who were howling in agony.** On their garments was written in large characters, "Thou art weighed in the balance, and found wanting." I asked who this company were. The angel said, **"These are they who have once kept the Sabbath and have given it up.**" I heard them cry with a loud voice, "We have believed in Thy coming, and taught it with energy." And while they were speaking, their eyes would fall upon their garments and see the writing, and then they would wail aloud. I saw they had drunk of the deep waters, and fouled the residue with their feet -- **trodden the Sabbath underfoot -- and that was why they were weighed in the balance and found wanting** (_Early Writings_, p. 37).

Dear reader, if you are a Seventh Day Adventist (SDA), remember _do not be afraid_ of what any false prophet says (Dt. 18:22), including Ellen G. White.

According to the General Index of _Early Writings_, the people in Ellen G. White's vision who were _howling in agony_ were _Apostate Sabbathkeepers_ (p. 307). How convenient to have such a vision that could prevent other Adventists from leaving their group as occurred after "The Disappointment" of Oct. 22, 1844:

> Almost immediately following the disappointment of October 22, **many believers and ministers who had associated themselves with the Advent message dropped away** (_Early Writings_, p. XV).

**What Ellen G. White called a "disappointment" the Bible calls a false prophecy!** (William Miller's false prophecy about the Lord's return on 10-22-1844 indicts him too.)



## William Miller Rejected SDA Sabbath Teaching!

**Ellen G. White was not consistent with her own vision though, for even William Miller turned from keeping the Sabbath, yet she said he would _not be held responsible_ and upon his death entered the _heavenly Canaan_**:

> At the time of the disappointment on October 22, 1844, Miller was worn and ill. He depended largely on his younger associates who stood with him in proclaiming the Advent message. **They led him to reject the Sabbath truth** as it came to his attention soon after the Disappointment. For this they, and **not William Miller, will be held responsible** (_Early Writings_, p. 303).

> So also, I saw that William Miller erred as **he was soon to enter the heavenly Canaan**, in suffering his influence to go against the truth (_Early Writings_, p. 258).

One must ask from these two Ellen G. White revelations: Is God a respecter of persons? The Bible clearly teaches NO (Acts 10:34). But if the apostate sabbathkeeper, William Miller, would not _be held responsible,_ as other apostate sabbathkeepers would, then either: (1) God is a respecter of persons, which is impossible or (2) Ellen G. White was not spreading God's truth to people!



## Do Angels Carry "Golden Cards" as Passes?

Some ardent SDA members seem to imply that Ellen G. White never went beyond Scripture with her visions, but merely confirmed the correct interpretation. This could not be further from the truth. The follow Ellen G. White vision mentions golden pass cards that angels need, yet **it is impossible for this to be verified with Scripture:**

> Then my attending angel directed me to the city again, where I saw four angels winging their way to the gate of the city. They were just presenting **the golden card** to the angel at the gate when I saw another angel flying swiftly from the direction of the most excellent glory, and crying with a loud voice to the other angels, and waving something up and down in his hand (_Early Writings_, 37).

Ellen G. White mentions the same elsewhere:

> All the angels that are commissioned to visit earth hold **a golden card**, which they present to the angels at the gates of the city as they pass in and out (_Early Writings_, p. 39).

Friend, there is not the slightest hint of angelic _golden cards_ in Scripture. **No Seventh-day Adventist can supply Scriptural support for such.** **Therefore, members of the SDA church go beyond the Bible for their beliefs and this is because of the writings of Ellen G. White, a Bible-defined _false prophetess._**



## Ellen G White vs Bible Truth - Sins Placed on Satan or Jesus

Where were our sins placed - on Satan or Jesus? The answer to that question depends on if you believe the revelations of Ellen G. White or the Bible. First, let's look at what Ellen G. White says:

> It was seen, also, that while the sin offering pointed to Christ as a sacrifice, and the high priest represented Christ as a mediator, **the scapegoat typified Satan, the author of sin, upon whom the sins of the truly penitent will finally be placed.** When the high priest, by virtue of the blood of the sin offering, removed the sins from the sanctuary, he placed them upon the scapegoat. When Christ, by virtue of His own blood, removes the sins of His people from the heavenly sanctuary at the close of his ministration, **he will place them upon Satan,** who, in the execution of the judgment, must bear the final penalty. The scapegoat was sent away into a land not inhabited, never to come again into the congregation of Israel. So will **Satan** be forever banished from the presence of God and His people, and he **will be blotted from existence** in the final destruction of sin and sinners (_The Great Controversy_, p. 422).

Now let's see what the Bible says:

> We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way; and **the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all** (Isa. 53:6).

> **God made him who had no sin to be sin for us,** so that in him we might become the righteousness of God (2 Cor. 5:21).

> **He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree**, so that we might die to sins and live for righteousness; by his wounds you have been healed (1 Pet. 2:24).

Clearly then, Ellen G. White has taught something very different from the word of God about this most important issue related to the plan of redemption. The truth is, our sins were laid on Jesus not Satan!

Ellen G. White also stated in the aforementioned revelation that Satan will finally be _blotted from existence._ Again, this is clearly different from Scripture:

> **And the devil**, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of burning sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. **They will be tormented day and night for ever and ever** (Rev. 20:10).

To _be tormented day and night for ever and ever_ is not blotted from existence, as Ellen G. White taught.



## What About The Year 1844?

Today, sincere Seventh Day Adventists believe that Jesus entered the most holy place of the Heaven Temple in 1844 to make final atonement:

> Thus those who follow in the light of the prophetic word saw that, instead of coming to the earth at the termination of the 2300 days in **1844, Christ then entered the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary to perform the closing work of atonement** preparatory to His coming (_The Great Controversy_, p. 422).

But before Oct. 22, 1844 the Seventh Day Adventists believed something very different:

> Hiram Edson, one of this group, lived in central New York State at Port Gibson. He was the leader of the Adventist in that area. **The believers met in his home on October 22, 1844, to await the coming of the Lord** (_Early Writings_, p. 18).

Elsewhere Ellen G. White wrote about this time period:

> Therefore, though they proclaimed **the message which God had committed to them to be given to the world**, yet through a misapprehension of its meaning they suffered disappointment (_The Great Controversy_, p. 352).

Dear reader, do you believe that _the message_ that Oct. 22, 1844 was to be the coming of the Lord was _the message which God had committed_ to William Miller and other Adventists to give to the world, as Ellen G. White wrote? **Is it possible that God would want that lie about Christ's coming to be taught to the world?** Isn't it impossible for God to lie? See Titus 1:2\. If Ellen G. White was a true prophetess for God how could she write like this? She could! **Ellen G White is clearly a _false prophet_.** Furthermore, in contrast to Ellen G. White, the Scriptures clearly teach something different about the point in time that the Lord entered the Most Holy Place. Please note that the following verses were written and fulfilled long before 1844:

> We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters **the inner sanctuary behind the curtain**, where **Jesus**, who went before us, **has entered** on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek (Heb.6:19,20).

> He did not enter by means of the blood of goats and calves; but **he entered the Most Holy Place** once for all by his own blood, having obtained eternal redemption (Heb. 9:12).

Please notice the past tense of the aforementioned word _entered._ But there is even more in Scripture to refute Ellen G. White. The following verse shows **the atonement was completed by the time Rom. 5:11 was written:**

> And not only so, but we also joy in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom **we have now received the atonement** (Rom. 5:11, KJV).



## _It Is Finished_ - NOT According To Ellen G White

To be more exact as to when the atonement was finished, let's consider the Lord's words from the cross:

> When he had received the drink, Jesus said, **It is finished.** With that, he bowed his head and gave up his spirit (John 19:30).

The words _It is finished_ do NOT mean the end of the moral law, but shows the plan of redemption was _finished_ at that point, according to the Lord Jesus. This is further confirmed by the following:

> And when Jesus had cried out again in a loud voice, he gave up his spirit. At that moment **the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.** The earth shook and the rocks split (Mt. 27:50,51).

The tearing of the temple's curtain, before the Holy of Holies, shows that the whole system of sacrifice for sins is now over with once and for all since "the Lamb of God" [Jesus] was slain on the cross for our sins. Clearly, there is no more sacrifice for sin **since the cross** (Heb.10:10-14). Col. 1:20 supplements this truth:

> And through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether things on earth or things in heaven, **by making peace through his blood, shed on the cross.**

In contrast to Scripture, Ellen G. White says:

> By His death **He began** that work which after His resurrection He ascended **to complete** in heaven (_The Great Controversy_, p. 489).

> Therefore the announcement that the temple of God was opened in heaven and the ark of His testament was seen points to the opening of the most holy place of the heavenly sanctuary **in 1844** as Christ entered there **to perform the closing work of the atonement** (_The Great Controversy_, p. 433).

**Dear reader, which conflicting record about the atonement will you believe?**

So where did Ellen G. White get the 1844 date? It comes from a misinterpretation of Dan. 8:14\. That verse reads:

> And he said unto me, Unto **two thousand and three hundred days;** then shall the sanctuary be cleansed (Dan 8:14, KJV).

By taking the 2300 days mentioned in Dan. 8:14 to mean 2300 years and adding that number to 457 BC, the year that Artaxerxes decreed the restoration and rebuilding of Jerusalem (Ezra 6:1,2), Ellen G. White got 1844\. Several points need to be made regarding this SDA interpretation:

(1) The SDA people use Ezk. 4:6 and Num. 14:34 to interpret a day to equal a year! But if one is going to reject that Daniel's 2300 days means 2300 literal 24-hour time periods, that is, a little over 6 years, then why shouldn't we use 2 Pet. 3:8 and Psa. 90:4 which states a day is 1,000 years! These verses are just as non-related to Dan 8:14 as Ezk. 4:6 and Num. 14:34!

(2) The NIV version does not say "days" in Dan. 8:14, but instead "evenings and mornings," which clarifies that these are 24 hour time periods, not years, months or anything else. **Daniel 8:14 does NOT say "days" in the Hebrew.**

(3) The context of Daniel's vision is from 8:9 to 8:27\. The context clearly shows the 2300 "evenings and mornings" (also in v. 26) is not years and it should not be calculated from 457 BC. Notice verses 13 and 14 together:

> Then I heard a holy one speaking, and another holy one said to him, "How long will it take for the vision to be fulfilled -- **the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, the rebellion that causes desolation, and the surrender of the sanctuary and of the host that will be trampled underfoot?"** He said to me, "It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the sanctuary will be reconsecrated."

NOTICE: Daniel's vision concerns: (1) the daily sacrifice, which the Antichrist will take away (v. 11), (2) the rebellion that causes desolation, (3) the surrender of the sanctuary and (4) the host that will be trampled underfoot. Clearly, the time frame of this is _the rebellion that causes desolation,_ as stated in v. 13\. Jesus referred to this same event in Mark 13:14-20\. There **the context is clearly the great tribulation period for it states then will be days of distress unequaled from the beginning of creation.** This shows that Ellen G. White, who has been clearly wrong numerous times and is guilty of false prophecy, has also misinterpreted the meaning of Dan. 8:14\. Ellen G. White has come up with something different about the atonement which Scripture says was done at the cross.



## What Should Seventh-Day Adventist Members Do?

What should SDA members do when they learn these revealing facts about Ellen G. White's unscriptural revelations, interpretations and false prophecies? They should cleave to Biblical truth only and forsake all teachings that conflict with it. **In other words, they should believe the Bible and turn away from Ellen G. White's teachings!**



## The True Plan Of Salvation

The true **[plan of salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)** is much different than presented by Ellen G. White! It is concisely stated in the Bible as **[**repentance towards God**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html) and faith in Christ Jesus (Acts 20:21).** We are to produce fruit in keeping with repentance (Mt. 3:8) and prove our repentance by our deeds (Acts 26:20). **To "repent" means to turn from your evil ways (Mt. 12:41 cf. Jonah 3:10).** Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire (Mt. 3:10; 7:19). The Lord Jesus also taught the road to life is **"hard"** and only a **"few"** will find it (Mt. 7:13,14, NKJV). The Lord declared there that there are ONLY 2 gates, 2 roads, 2 groups of people and 2 eternal destinies. So don't follow the crowd, since they are on their way to eternal fire, even though they might not know it.

Moreover, many get saved, but afterwards fall away (Lk. 8:13; Jn. 6:66; 1 Tim. 1:19; etc.). In other words, **after initial salvation we must endure to the "end" to enter the kingdom of God and escape the lake of fire (Mt. 10:22; Heb. 3:14; Rev. 2:10,11).** Eternal life comes to the repentant the moment such believe on Jesus for salvation (Jn. 3:16; 6:47; 1 Jn. 5:12,13), but there is another important aspect of eternal life that many are totally unaware of in our day because of a different false teaching which is commonly called "**[once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**." **According to true, Biblical, grace teaching, eternal life is also a HOPE (Titus 3:7), yet to be REAPED (Gal. 6:8,9) in the AGE TO COME (Mk. 10:30) for only the ones who PERSIST IN DOING GOOD (Rom. 2:7) and DO NOT GROW WEARY AND GIVE UP (Gal. 6:9).**

Also, remember this: If a saved person sows to please his sinful nature he'll die spiritually (Rom. 8:13; Gal. 6:8,9). The prodigal is a clear example of this (Lk. 15:24,32). The end result of sin is spiritual death. DO NOT BE DECEIVED by the "once saved, always saved" teachers (James 1:14-16). We must continue to believe (TRUST) on Jesus for our soul's salvation to enter the Kingdom of God. Jesus described his "sheep" as his "followers" (John 10:27). James stated that faith without works is "dead" (James 2:17). **[For more information about the teaching of once saved always saved consult our 801 page **NO [eternal security book](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelical-books.html)** entitled: _The Believer's Conditional Security_. It is available in softback, hardback and voice book.]**

In conclusion, Jesus successfully destroyed the devil's work (1 John 3:8). He is the resurrected "Lord of glory" (1 Cor. 2:8), before whom every knee will bow and every tongue confess that he is Lord (Phil. 2:9-11). Jesus has the ONLY name in which salvation is found (Acts 4:12), is the ONLY mediator between God and man (1 Tim. 2:5) and is the judge of the living and the dead (Acts 10:42; 2 Tim. 4:1; 1 Pet. 4:5). **He also bore our sins (2 Cor. 5:21). Moreover, **[Jesus Christ is NOT Michael the archangel](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/who-is-michael-the-archangel.htm)**!** We are advised in Scripture to go directly to Him for forgiveness and to TRUST in Him alone for our soul's salvation. **He also warned us of false prophets like _Ellen G White!_**
