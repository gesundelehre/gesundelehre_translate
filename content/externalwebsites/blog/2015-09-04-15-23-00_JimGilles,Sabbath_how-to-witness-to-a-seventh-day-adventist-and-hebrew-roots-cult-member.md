Cult Member: keeping the 4th Command / Leviticus 23 Sabbath Days of YHVH is the easiest of ALL Commands... yet rejected by most who say they are in Covenant with the Giver. 

Jim Gilles: I keep Sabbath each and every day per Hebrews.

Cult Member: do you wear your best clothes when you do common jobs such as yardwork or working on your car?  If you keep Sabbath everyday, then you don't work but spend every single day and every single moment reading your Bible and worshiping Heavenly Father.  Correct?

Jim Gilles:  Christ is my Sabbath.  I rest in Him!

Cult Member: I keep my Heavenly Father's 4th Command.

Jim Gilles: So do I.

Cult Member: Your god must be the one created by the pagan Roman Catholic Church.  You speak the same lying words that he does.  ;)

Jim Gilles: Which words are you talking about? The book of Hebrews was written well before the creation of the RCC.

Cult Member:  "I keep Sabbath each and every day" Now where is that Instruction of YHVH found in Leviticus 23?

Jim Gilles: It is found in the book of Hebrews.

Cult Member: So the Book of Hebrews is a REPLACEMENT Book?

Jim Gilles: No, "not a replacement book" but an explanation book for some of the OTs types and shadows.  Is the book of Hebrews of equal validity to you as the book of Leviticus?  It is to me.  Hebrews gives some of the antitypes to the OT types and shadows.

Cult Member: Types and shadows of what is to come....Future events..... YES or NO.

Jim Gilles: You must be specific as to what you are talking about.  I have no clue what you mean.  The OT gives types and shadows.  The NT reveals and explains the OT types and shadows.

Jim Gilles: For example?

Jim Gilles: The 4th commandment of the Sabbath Day rest is explained in the book of Hebrews as a type and shadow of the believer's rest in Christ.

Cult Member: Leviticus 23 is all about YHVH's 4th Command Sabbaths and fully explained in Leviticus 23. Those Sabbaths are still for today. Yes or No.

Jim Gilles: Yes, God's Sabbath is still for today.  God's Sabbath is now found, experienced and practiced by believing in Christ...the Lord of Sabbaoth.

Cult Member: So you will be keeping YHVH's Sabbath tonight at sundown.... Correct?

Jim Gilles: I am keeping God's Sabbath right now and I will also be keeping it tonight and tomorrow.

Cult Member: RIIIIGHT.... :P  Torah tells me not to have any relationship with those who reject the Perfect TRUTH of YHVH's Words.

Dusting off my sandals to speak to those who actually desire to have a relationship with my Heavenly Father.  I will pray for you.....

Jim Gilles: Do you hold the book of Hebrews of equal validity as the Torah?

Cult Member: The first 5 Books are the Words of Yeshua spoken to and through Moses.  They are the foundation Word which gives LIFE.

Jim Gilles: Do you offer red hefers, goats, turtle doves and lambs as blood sacrifices?

Cult Member: Deuteronomy 8:3 CJB He humbled you, allowing you to become hungry, and then fed you with man, which neither you nor your ancestors had ever known, to make you understand that a person does not live on food alone but on everything that comes from the Mouth of YHVH.

Jim Gilles: Who is your high priest?  What is his name?

Cult Member: Matthew 4:4 CJB  Yeshua answered, "The Tanakh says, `Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes from the Mouth of YHVH"  Yeshua is my High Priest.... The Perfect Order of Melchizedek.

Jim Gilles: Oh, so now you admit that there is a NT.  Great, we are getting somewhere.  Is the book of Hebrews also in your canon of scripture?

Cult Member: Melchizedek is in Genesis. It is Yeshua who meets with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, etc.

Jim Gilles:  If you acknowledge that Jesus is the antitype to the types and shadows of the high priestly ministry of the OT then why do you not accept that Jesus is also our Sabbath rest per Hebrews?  If Jesus is your high priest then why is Jesus not your Sabbath?

Cult Member: Your god is the one created by the pagan Roman Catholic Church 1700 years ago.  You even use his pagan name.
 
Jim Gilles: Jesus is the perfect order of Melchizedek per Hebrews.  Hebrews also tells us that Jesus is our Sabbath.  You can not have one without the other if you are using Hebrews as your source for Jesus being the high priest.

Cult Member: Does a type and shadow pass away?  Did Leviticus 23 pass away?

Jim Gilles: We already heard your RCC prerecorded message.

Cult Member: Did the 4th Command pass away?

Jim Gilles Did the OT high priest pass away?  You just said that it did in Jesus.

Cult Member: Your words are the same as the pagan Roman Catholic Church.  Lawless is as lawless does......

Jim Gilles: We all see how that when you get backed into a corner that you duck, dodge and run to your memorized RCC accusations.
