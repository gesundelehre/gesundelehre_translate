## Does *Sin Addiction* Have You Bound 

**The vast problem of _sin addiction_ and the spiritual remedy is not always taught in church!

[![drunkenness, drunk, alcoholic, alcoholism](../../files/pictures/sin-addictions-pornography-drunkenness.jpg "Being a DRUNKARD is a spiritual issue and getting Biblically saved is the sure remedy.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/slave.htm)

That is why we all need to search the pages of the Bible for ourselves to learn the vital truths of God, especially about _salvation._** In that regard, if there has ever been a chapter *describing the Christian* that has been hated and avoided by the popular religious leaders of our day it has to be Romans 6. This is especially true among the eternal security proponents who want us to think:

[![sin addiction](../../files/pictures/sin-addiction.jpg "sin addiction")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)

(1) we must **[sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html)** all the time and (2) distort grace into something it isn't. They wrongly apply Romans 7:14-25 to the *Christian* and wickedly avoid Romans 6 or grossly distort it. Romans 6 is the freed from sin addictions **_[Christian](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html)_** - not Romans 7:14-25, as most have been wrongly taught. The following is *true grace teaching and shows what really happens at the point of a real salvation and what the **[new creation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/new-creation.html)** is:* 
  
> What shall we say, then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may increase? By no means! **We died to sin**; how can we live in it any longer? (Rom 6:1,2)

<big>[This Is What The TRUTH WILL SET YOU FREE Means](#sin_addictions)</big>

A person must *die to sin* to get spiritual life. This is another way of saying *repent or perish* (Luke 13:3; 2 Peter 3:9), turn from idols to serve God (1 Thess. 1:9), love and obey Jesus before all others (Mt. 10:37,38), believe on Jesus (John 3:16; Acts 16:31), etc. If a person is not willing to let go of his idols he can NOT be saved and will not be freed from sin addictions by Jesus' blood (Rev. 1:5), even if he prays a prayer, confesses Jesus, gets baptized, joins a congregation, etc. He must sincerely, wholeheartedly turn away from his wicked sinful life. 
  
> Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were therefore buried with him through baptism into death in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life. If we have been united with him like this in his death, we will certainly also be united with him in his resurrection. (Rom 6:3-5) 

Christians have been baptized into Christ's death, had their old selves (sinful nature) crucified with him (v.6), and now have a *new life.* Crucifying the sinful nature is a must pre-requisite for **[salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)**: 
  
> Those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires. (Gal 5:24) 

Many are walking around thinking they were saved and have never *crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires*. Paul went on to write: 
  
> For we know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be [**slaves to sin**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/slave.htm) - because anyone who has died has been freed from sin. (Rom 6:6,7)

## How To Get Free From *Sin Addiction* 

**A person has to die to self to live.** Verse 7 is the key to getting set free from sin addiction. 
  
> Now if we died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him. For we know that since Christ was raised from the dead, he cannot die again; death no longer has mastery over him. The death he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life he lives, he lives to God. **In the same way**, count yourselves dead to sin but alive to God in Christ Jesus. (Rom 6:8-11) 

Jesus' death and resurrection is cited as an _analogy_ to how the Christian is to view sin and his new life in Christ. 
  
> Therefore **do not let sin reign in your mortal body** so that you **[obey](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/obey.html)** its evil desires. (Rom 6:12) 
 
[![slave to sin](../../files/pictures/devil-battle.jpg "slave to sin")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/slave.htm)

Sin is _personified_ and clearly shown to want to _reign_ or control even people who were truly saved. It is, therefore, the Christian's choice and responsibility (not God's) to stop sin from reigning in his corruptible body he now has. Again, **the Christian's life is shown to be a fight against sin (Heb. 12:4)**. The false teachers who say, _sin is no longer the issue since Calvary_, miss a major part of the New Testament and dangerously distort grace, but that goes with tickling ears and deceiving people for the sake of popularity, money and avoiding persecution: 
  
> Do not offer the parts of your body to sin, as instruments of wickedness, but rather offer yourselves to God, as those who have been brought from death to life; and offer the parts of your body to him as instruments of righteousness. For sin shall not be your master, because you are not under law, but under grace. What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means! Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey - whether you are slaves to sin, **which leads to death**, or to **obedience, which leads to righteousness**? (Rom 6:16) 

**Romans 6:16 is a verse every Christian should memorize**. It is powerfully clear that one is either a _slave to sin_ or a _slave to obedience._ The former leads to _death_, while the latter leads to _righteousness_. 

**NOTE: In Rom. 6:16, Paul taught about _righteousness_, but it was NOT an imputed righteousness as he speaks of elsewhere. _It is OBEDIENCE which leads to righteous._ That truth is another major contradiction to the grace changers who want us to think we all must sin all the time. It should be apparent why they avoid Romans 6 as they do!** 
  
> But thanks be to God that, though **you used to be slaves to sin**, you **wholeheartedly** obeyed the form of teaching to which you were entrusted. (Rom 6:17)

## Jesus Can Set You Free From ALL *Sin Addiction* 

If a person wants salvation and the freedom from sin which comes with it, he is going to have to **_wholeheartedly_** get committed to the Lord Jesus. There is no substitute for this. Getting **_set free from sin's addictions_** is also what Jesus taught: 
  
> To the Jews who had believed him, Jesus said, "If you hold to my teaching, you are really my disciples. Then you will know the truth, and **the truth will set you free**." They answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves of anyone. How can you say that we shall be set free?" Jesus replied, "**I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave to sin. Now a slave has no permanent place in the family, but a son belongs to it forever. So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed.**" (John 8:31-36) 

![sin addiction](../../files/pictures/SETFREE.jpg) 

Paul taught the same truth in Romans 6. **Jesus sets us _free_ from sin's slavery by his blood at the point of** [**repentance**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html). 
  
> You have been set free from sin **and have become slaves to righteousness**. (Rom 6:18) 

**Most who profess salvation in our day know nothing about either of those truths. They have never been set free from their sin addictions and are not slaves to righteousness, yet profess salvation and believe [once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**. The _new creation_ (2 Cor. 5:17) and the works of grace in a person's life will make him a _slave to righteousness_. 
  
> I put this in human terms because you are weak in your natural selves. Just as you used to offer the parts of your body in slavery to impurity and to ever-increasing wickedness, so **now offer them in slavery to [righteousness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/righteous.html) leading to [holiness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/holiness-preaching.html)**. (Rom 6:19) 

Remember **_it is slavery to righteousness which leads to holiness._** This is true _holiness_ preaching under grace and not a _works salvation, legalism_ or _cult._ 
  
> When **you were slaves to sin**, you were free from the control of righteousness. (Rom 6:20) 

**_All people before salvation are a slave to sin,_** but this is changed at the point of initial salvation (getting born again). This doesn't mean, however, that unsaved people can't ever show great kindness to others, for they can, even as a slave to sin. This is shown at the island of Malta: 
  
> Once safely on shore, we found out that the island was called Malta. The islanders showed us **unusual kindness**. They built a fire and welcomed us all because it was raining and cold. (Acts 28:1,2) 

Other examples can also be cited. 
  
> What benefit did you reap at that time from the things you are **now ashamed of**? Those things result in **death**! (Rom 6:21) 

This is one of the evidences of salvation by grace - **a person is ashamed of their past sins**. A professing Christian who brags about his past sins is _not_ saved. Paul only showed his regret and shame for what he did when in spiritual darkness and death, before getting born again. Such is the changed heart, as he states here. 
  
> But **now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves to God**, the benefit you reap leads to **holiness**, and the result is **eternal life**. For the wages of sin is **death**, but the gift of God is **eternal life** in Christ Jesus our Lord. (Rom 6:22,23) 
 
**Romans 6:22 is another verse most Bible believers do not know exists. It should also be memorized and taught often to others.** It too shows deadly errors in what people have been taught. Verses 22 and 23 go together, yet they are split apart, even in the _Romans Road_ gospel presentation, although they both mention **_eternal life._** 
 
NOTE: Verse 23 mentions _death_ and _eternal life_. They are contrasted to each other. A person is in one or the other depending upon his **_faith,_** which is manifested by _disobedience or obedience_. As sin leads to _death_, **_[holiness](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/keep-yourself-pure.html) from being a slave to God leads to eternal life_**. Have you ever heard that taught before? That is also the truth that is concealed by spitting apart verses 22 and 23, but is connected with _salvation_ itself. **Please tell others how to be freed from sin addiction.** God bless you.
