# <u>Exploding the Myths of Reformed Theology</u>

Exposing the Myths of inability, born in sin, saved in sin and all the doctrinal fallacies necessitated by them.

## 1. Let the Wicked forsake his Way

<u>**Man is a sinner by Choice Not by Nature, so the Bible Does teach:**</u>

> _A simple man believes in every word, but an astute man comes to Repentance. A wise man turns away from evil, but a man without discernment persuades himself to mingle with a lawless man._

_**Prov14:15-16**_

> _An evil man does evil things with arrogance. But those who know themselves are wise._

_**Prov13:11**_

> _Those who repaid me evil for good, slandered me because I purpose Righteousness. Ps37:21_

<u>This teaches us that an evil man is not evil by nature but by choice.</u> They have chosen **not** to know Wisdom and instruction. Therefore wisdom cannot be found among them. But perception and discernment are two aspects of the wise, if they choose to know wisdom and follow after Righteousness. By the wrong use of the Will evil overtakes a person and they become <u>self deceived also by choice.</u> If the Nature of man was corrupt he could not correct or discipline himself, he would be forced to live according to his basic instincts. (like an animal) But the nature is <u>inherently good,</u> fully capable of making Right choices. This is the reason that nothing unrighteous will ever be pleasing to the righteous. (Prov12:23) They have by their own free will **CHOSEN** to Repent Stop sinning and follow after God. What makes the Present day message of Substitution (saved in sin) Gospel so deadly to the soul is that <u>Free Choice is negated</u> by the fallacy of a disabled will.

That's why the Scripture says a '_**Simple man believes every word'**_. The simple minded are always easily deceived by smooth words and flattering speech. (Rom16:18) It's difficult to admit to this but anyone who rejects God's Wisdom, reproof and instruction in favor of sinning daily in thought, word and deed, is **simple** in mind. (meaning they will believe almost anything they are told without question) They can never see through the deceptions of sin and their need for a full departure from wrong doings. The deceived are self deceived by their own vices, the soft message of a do nothing gospel presented to their minds in great swelling words of emptiness, promising them liberty in their sins (2Pet2:18) is impossible to resist. It's the **PERFECT** device for them to never stop sinning and devise even more excuses to escape their responsibility to **obey** God and repent.

Herein is the Reason so **Few** are coming to a Saving knowledge of the truth. The mechanism of free will has been disabled by the Preaching of fallacy. Their natural God given ability to choose the Right Path is canceled out by an <u>imaginary sinful</u> <u>nature</u> invented by the Doctrines of men. Therefore they can '<u>**never stop'**</u> sinning and God must devise a method to Justify them **'in sin'**. Thus you have Substitution, the magic transfer and eternal security, equaling 'Saved in Sin' or as falsely preached: '_While we were yet sinners Christ died for us'_ Rom5:8, in their minds meaning the ungodly are <u>Justified 'in their sins'.</u> (Rom4:5-8) As though God does not demand you **FIRST TURN** from your sins in repentance and come clean as the Scriptures repeatedly point out.

> _Let the wicked forsake his way, And the unrighteous man his thoughts; Let him return to the LORD, And He will have mercy on him; And to our God, For He will abundantly pardon._

_**Isa55:7**_

> _Now therefore, amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; then the LORD will relent concerning the doom that He has pronounced against you._

_**Jer26:13**_

So when we say that a person is<u>**Not 'Saved' in their sins**</u><u>,</u> we Mean that he is **NOT** Saved while **STILL** Committing sin because he is FULLY Capable of amending his ways and forsaking evil in the process of Repentance Proven by Deeds. This means that sins of the flesh such as fornication, adultery, drunkenness, uncleanness, lying, cheating, stealing, foul communications and evil dispositions **cease**. I understand this goes against the grain of the things professing Christians have been taught in the religious establishment and now believe are true. (and base their fictitious Salvation on) BUT the Bible **Clearly** shows that a<u>**'broken and contrite' heart**</u> (Ps51:17) crying out for God's Mercy **has ceased from the sin** that brought him to this place of humility.

<u>**King David**</u> (often sited as the professed prime example of their inevitably to sin) had **CEASED** from his sin when he bitterly repented and cried out to God. (Psalm 51) Similar to the other Biblical examples of Repentance shown in Jonah 3:5-10 where the **ENTIRE** City of Nineveh **TURNED** from their evil ways from the King down and cried out to God for Mercy in hopes of finding a reprieve. Zacchaeus the chief tax collector Lk19:1-10, **Amended** his fraudulent ways **BEFORE** meeting up with the Lord and being pronounced Saved. Even the Prodigal Son Lk15:11-32, is said to have **'Came to himself'** and rose up **OUT** of the Pig Pen to return to the Father.<u>**NO ONE**</u> can be Justified while they remain in Known Willful Rebellion to God on the mere Virtue of Christ's Death. The **OFFER** of Reconciliation has gone out to all men everywhere to Repent TURN from their evil deeds and be Saved! 2Cor5:20, Acts17:30

The Bible tells us that <u>Without Faith</u> that is impossible to please God, for those who come to Him must first Believe that He is and He **REWARDS** those who <u>Diligently</u> <u>Seek</u> Him out. (Heb11:6) This requires putting forth a determined **EFFORT** of the Will to discover God's Truth; (as in Ask, Seek, Knock Mt7:7 a _continual_ action!) In Scripture FAITH is '**Accomplishing'** a task. (Heb11:4 by faith **Able OBTAINED** witness that he was righteous, offering God a MORE Excellent Sacrifice than his brother Cain) This means he put forth a diligent effort to place himself in Conformity to God's requirements)

<u>Here's where we loose the '</u><u>**saved in sin'**</u> folks who love the Instant Burger King Religion. The Professing Christian Establishment is acclimated to a quick and easy form of Salvation. Get them _'Saved'_ attached to the Church and into a program designed to pacify their addiction. Going to all the trouble to **ACTUALLY** bring them OUT of their wrongdoings doesn't fit into the schedule nor does it meet up with the criterion of their Doctrines. Rudimentary Faith (_Js2:19 the devils believe!_) is enough; Confession and Trusting in a Magic Provision that God has you covered and understands that your 'sinfulness' is a malady you have no control over. Timeframe is their acid test.


## 2. Real Repentance

<u>**Real Repentance**</u> can be either instantaneous or a **Process** of brokenness, weeping, separating from sin and crying out to God. That's the great difficulty today among Church Pundits and many Street type preachers. They want **INSTANT** results! (Like in the Book of Acts)<u>**However**</u> we're no longer in the midst of Apostolic Preaching. We are in the Season of <u>Strong Delusion,</u> ear tickling doctrines and a religious establishment who has turned the Truth of God into a Lie. (2Thess2:10-12, 2Tim4:3-4) <u>A Genuine Repentance</u> in the present day will indeed require a **SEASON** of godly sorrow for sin brought about in a Crisis of Conviction through the Preaching of the Word. (Rom10:17) Since the Holy Spirit is called the 'Spirit <u>of Truth'</u> in Scripture 1Jh4:6 and is responsible to Convict the World of Sin, Righteousness and Judgment to Come Jh16:8, **ANY** form of error (spirit of error) that impedes this Process will **QUENCH** (extinguish, suppress) the Redemptive Progression.

The Penitent Person **MUST** be allowed to make a <u>Clean Break</u> from his vile sins of the flesh and be given time to muster the motivation to right many of his wrongs done to others. (if possible) This is why Scripture records that a <u>godly sorrow</u> <u>leading to repentance</u> 2Cor7:10-11 **PRODUCES** a Vehement Desire and Zeal to Vindicate oneself of all wrong doing and set the record straight with God! These are the<u>**DEEDS**</u> (fruit)_<u>**meet**</u>_ for Repentance. (_axious_: something having weight or worth of value. Meriting anything worthy, Mt3:8, Lk3:8)<u>**Called also**</u>: Amending of evil ways, Ceasing to do evil, laying aside all filthiness and overflow of wicked behavior, cleansing yourself of all filthiness of the flesh and spirit. (Jer26:13, Isa1:16, Js1:21, 2Cor7:1) As seen from the Penitent's ¦finite point of view this is the<u>**DEPARTURE**</u>from Iniquity Required by everyone who Names the Name of Christ! 2Tim2:19.

The Holy Spirit is instrumental in bringing about the conviction of godly sorrow, BUT the human WILL Working in concert with God puts forth the **EFFORT** to Change in '_<u>self cleansing'</u>_ humility that has a deep impact and lasting effect on the Mind, Purposes, Opinions, Inclinations and Dispositions toward sin. It is what you would expect to see in a person who has done you great harm as in the case of an unfaithful or abusive spouse. Even as a human you would accept nothing less than a Clean break from the wrong doing and a **TOTAL** Transformation in their behavior. <u>WHY should God be expected to accept lessmerely</u> because heaps of <u>'sin everyday'</u> preachers find it in the best interest of religious harmony to promote a 500 year old fallacy that turns Salvation into a Magic Formula in which a person is Justified in their sins.Denying that man possesses the Willingness to STOP sinning!?

<u>**Herein is the Vast Difference**</u> between Bible Redemption and men's counterfeit Model; Diligence and Purposeful Effort put forth from the basis of one's Will. In the Professed Christian world view timeframe restricts **ABILITY** and the _**'Self Revenge'** _(vindication of personal wrong doings) of Repentance 2Cor7:11, it can NEVER take place. Therefore the Person 'saved <u>in sin'</u> Remains **in sin** and can Never be **FIT** for the Master's use.

> _But in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and clay, some for honor and some for dishonor. Therefore if anyone  <u>**cleanses himself**</u> from the latter, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified and useful for the Master, prepared for every good work._

_**2Tim2:20-21**_

They are only **FIT** for having a '_**name for being alive but are Dead'**_ (Rev3:1) They have failed to do their **FIRST** Works and come clean with God in Repentance. (Rev2:5) <u>Therefore a Genuine Redemption cannot take place.</u> You Cannot be Purged of your past sins (Rom3:25) while Still in the process of present sin. (Jh5:14, 8:11) You can have a '_form of godliness'_ with all the trimmings of church life; ever learning and never quite coming to a real knowledge of the truth. (2Tim3:5) And you can even zealously pursue the focus groups that minister to your personal struggles and find assurance in the soothing effect among others facing the same issues, but love Jesus. **BUT** if you **REALLY** Loved Him you would<u>**HATE**</u> <u>your Sin and</u> <u>**STOP**</u> <u>Sinning!!</u> The eyes of the Understanding **enlightened** to the Truth, Eph1:18, can <u>ONLY</u> take Place in the **Renewing** of the Mind. (Rom6:4-6, 12:1-2) Unless True Redemption takes place as the final act of Repentance, man Remains in his Darkness inventing more **Myths** to excuse sin.

<u>The final act of Repentance is being</u> <u>**Reconciled**</u> (returned to favor) to God and **Purged** of past sins by the Blood of Christ (Heb9:14) until then you have merely done a good deed by stopping your destructive behavior. You may now be reconciled to wronged family members or a scorned spouse. People can stop drinking, taking drugs, committing adultery or any manner of unclean behavior for all sorts of reason, but unless it's done unto God in Repentance and faith proven by deeds you remain still in your sins. It's a <u>Diligent Effort of the Free Will</u> that brings man to Gods' Mercy Seat (for Propitiation, Rom3:25) where you as the '_**living sacrifice'**_ are sprinkled with the Blood of the offering (Christ) and thus **Purged** of Past sins, dead works and _**Purified**_ in heart for Service to God. (Heb9:14) **NOW** you have taken the final steps from Darkness to Light from the Power of Satan to God! (Acts26:18) ALL turning on man's<u>**ABILITY to DO**</u> what God commands. (working together with HIM! Js2:22) If this natural Ability has been _'short circuited'_ by the **FABLES** & Vain babblings of men, 1Tim6:20, (Substitution, Moral transfer, Magic Cover, not of works, born in sin, can never stop sinning) Strong Delusion will settle in and finally complete Reprobation of the Mind and then the Soul can no longer Respond to God. That's why Jesus Said:

> _The lamp of the body is the eye. If therefore your eye is good, your whole body will be full of light. But if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If therefore the light that is in you is darkness, how **GREAT** is that darkness!_

_**Mt6:22-23**_

<u>God's Complete Plan of Redemption is to</u> **HEAL** the Mind of man by Turing him from the Destructive nature of Sin. This REQUIRES man to exercise his natural senses of 'hearing', 'Sight' and 'understanding' (the reason, will, mind! Mt13:15) If he Indeed uses the faculties God gave him, his **MIND** will be healed from Delusions, Myths, Doctrines of men, Fables, speculations and vain Philosophies, all resulting from the corrupting influence of sin.

This is <u>**SYNERGY**</u> expressed in its highest form! (Two or more things working together to produce a result that cannot otherwise be obtained!) God has set forth this Marvelous conception at the dawn of Creation. Adam was given free choice in the Garden and his progeny that followed. (to this day!) His sin did not corrupt the Nature of man or his Ability to choose between right and wrong. <u>The Nature is</u> <u>inherently good at birth!</u> John1:9: _That was the true Light which gives light to every man coming into the world._ **THIS** is the <u>Light of Conscience</u> at the base of Free Will --- That acts as an inner Witness to 'accuse or excuse' your moral compass.

<u>You DON'T 'Save yourself'</u> by getting clear of sin in Repentance. It was God's Spirit convicting the world of Sin, Righteousness and Judgment to Come that brought you to this place of humility. God's hand is out-stretched daily to mankind, He is not willing any perish in their sin. He has no Pleasure in the death of wicked! His Part is <u>ON GOING</u> . The Holy Spirit Draws willing Seekers to the Cross (Jh12:32) HE Cannot & **WILL NOT** supersede man's Will!

Those who insist on maintaining the age old excuses of inability rendering man incapable of simple Obedience to God's Commands will **NEVER** see the Synergy of Redemption. To them God is defined by their Systematic theologies disseminated in the Vain imaginations of men. The Doctrine in accord with godliness 1Tim6:3, the wholesome Words of Christ Himself, is heresy to them, because it asks them to **DO** something they have no **INTENTION** of Doing! They **WANT** to be _Saved in their sins_, because they **LOVE** wrong doing.

So the Excuses will Continue to abound and NOTHING we can ever say, backed up by TONS of Bible Truth will ever Suffice until they make that <u>DETERMINDED</u> <u>CHOICE</u> to Come Out of the delusion and Seek God.

<u>**Basically this Message of Repentance proven by deeds**</u> is being presented to the Minds of People who believe they have already been Saved in their Sins, and Can Never Stop sinning sustained in a thousand other excuses.


## 3. Common Dispersions parroted by professing Christians

If we say you must stop sinning in Repentance, They say if a person could stop sinning they wouldn't need Jesus and could save themselves. This involves a <u>fictitious Timeframe</u> idea that if they could stop sinning a week, month, ect then God would accept them TOTALLY negates the idea of godly sorrow for sin a season of breaking away. 2Cor7:10-11

If we then point out that no one ever stops sinning even **WITH** Jesus, they will say if we claim to have no sin we lie and the truth is not in us. Fallacy of 1Jh1:8

If we show them not all sins are the same, they will say if you broke one you broke them all, fallacy of Jas2:10\. They are Blind to Sins unto death and not unto death. 1Jh5:16

If we show that you must come clean with God before He can grant you mercy, Jas1:21, they say He will Clean you up later. But they NEVER get clean, so no Redemption has taken place. If we go on to show we must Work together with Him in Salvation, they will say it's not of works, Eph2:8-9\. They are Denying Synergy paramount in True Redemptions. 2Cor6:1, Js2:22

If we say that it's he who Does what who is Right is Righteous, they say he's Self Righteous & call us lairs. 1Jh3:7-8\. In their minds no one has ever been Righteous and all Christians are: filthy Rags, Desperately Wicked, Wretched, Chief of sinners. Isa64:6, Jer17:9-10

If we show that a person is Justified Declared Righteous before God by what he DOES and NOT by faith alone, Js2:22, they will say David and Abraham were imputed righteous apart from works, while still in sin because God Justifies the ungodly and died for us while we were yet sinners. Rom4:5-8, 5:8 As though by the mere Virtue of Christ's Death man is Magically Justified without need of Reconciliation. 2Cor5:20

Although one of the very last things the Lord told His Disciples in Lk24:47 is that Repentance and Remission of sins should be preached to all nations, MANY pundits today deny that Repentance is a mandate for Salvation. Thus they have SHUT UP the Kingdom against men, neither do they go in themselves nor do they ALLOW others who are entering to go in. Matt23:13

> _Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves. You will know them by their fruits._

_**Matt 7:15**_


## 4. What Must I do to inherit Eternal Life?

<u>**When asked this very question Jesus Responded**</u>:

> _And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?" He said to him, "What is written in the law? What is your reading of it?" So he answered and said, 'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.'" And He said to him, "You have answered rightly; <u>do this and you will live.</u>_

_**Lk10:25-28**_

> _Then one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning together, perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, "Which is the first commandment of all?" Jesus answered him, "The first of all the commandments is: 'Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the LORD is one. And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength. 'This is the first commandment. And the second, like it, is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself. 'There is no other commandment greater than these." So the scribe said to Him, "Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth, for there is one God, and there is no other but He. And to love Him with all the heart, with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices." Now when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, He said to him, "You <u>are not far from the kingdom</u> <u>of God.</u>_

_**Mk12:28-34**_

Is this inline with Acts2:38-39, Rom10:9-10, Eph2:8-9?

Let's See what the Bible Says about Faith:

- Faith WORKS by Love **Gal5:6**

- _Upholds and Establishes the law **Rom3:31**_

- _Walks in the Righteous Requirements of the Law **Rom8:1-4**_

- _Purifies the heart by Obedience to the truth **1Pet1:22**_

- _Has Victory over the world, flesh and devil **1Jh5:4-5**_

So if you 'Believe' God, you will also 'Love' Him and **OBEY** His Word. Therefore as Christ said; 'on THIS hang ALL the Law and Prophets!'

> _Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?" Jesus said to him, "'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind, This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' <u>On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets."</u>_

_**Matt22:36-40**_

<u>WHY then in the Professing Christian Establishment Churches people are told:</u>

To Just Trust, Receive, and Repeat after me, it's not of works, no effort is required!

<u>When Jesus has Already Said:</u>

- Strive to Enter the Narrow Gate **Lk13:24**

- _Dig Deep into the Foundation of Truth **Lk6:48**_

- _Count the Cost of Discipleship **Lk14:28**_

- _Take up your Cross, Deny Self & Follow Me_ _**Lk9:23**_ 

- _Hunger and thirst for Righteousness **Matt5:6**_

- _Bare Fruit Worthy of Repentance **Mt3:8, Lk3:8**_

HOW can anyone come to Christ unless they OBEY what He Said? YET Millions THINK they have indeed received Jesus but have Never Put forth a single Effort to DO what the Lord Commands.

> _But He said, "More than that, blessed are those who hear the word of God and **keep it!**"_

_**Lk11:28**_


## 5. Can you Sin and Not Die?

> _"You will not surely die!"_

_**Satan, Gen3:4**_

Most Professing Christians today Do Not Believe that if they Live according to their fleshly desires they will die Spiritually. _For if you live according to the flesh you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live_ _**Rom8:13**_

<u>The reasons for this vary, among them are:</u>

Substitution, inability, Moral Transfer, Pre-forgiveness of sin & Eternal Security.

But Regardless the Constant among Professing Christians is to argue in favor of sin, by trusting in the above fallacies and mimicking the common excuses that: 'We're Born in Sin, Saved in Sin and Can Never Stop Sinning, because no one can be as Perfect as God' When told they Must get clear of their wrong doings in the process of Repentance **BEFORE** God will pardon them or grant His Holy Spirit to indwell their soul, they always retreat to the adage: "If we could stop sinning we wouldn't need Jesus and could save ourselves!" However, as someone once said; "Neither can they Stop sinning **AFTER** they have Jesus!"

<u>Let's Clarify what kinds of Sin we are talking about here.</u> What is it you Must<u>**STOP**</u>doing to inherit the Kingdom?

The collective opinion is NOTHING, only UNBELIEF will keep you out of the Kingdom. Therefore such vile behavior as listed below are widespread among

professed Christians:

<u>1Cor6:9-10, Gal5:19-21, Eph5:5-7,</u>

Fornication, idolatry (double-mined love of world), adultery, homosexuality, thieves, covetousness, drunkards, foul mouthed, murder, hatred, contention, Jealously, outburst of anger, selfish ambition, dissensions, heresy, uncleanness, filthiness, coarse jesting and foolish talking. <u>Add to this:</u> Mass complacency, obstinate, outright rebellion to God's authority, Disobedience to the Lord's Commands, total Disregard of Bible Truth!

Under the Common Sin, Repent, Sin Repent Model of 1John1:8-9, anything goes and all is forgiven. If anyone claims they do not commit such sins unto death, they are Purified in heart & mind, walking Obediently, Doing what is Right by faith working by love, they are immediately called a LIAR, Self Righteous hypocrite, angry Judge, Lost. <u>But this is from People who think:</u> They are Born and Saved in Sin that all Sins are the same & No One can ever Stop Sinning. They come to the plate with four strikes against them! Digging out of this kind of Deception is almost impossible. That's why it's called: Strong Delusion.

<u>In the Bible we find MANY 'Righteous' Saints, Pure before God:</u>

**Paul Acts24:16** _This being so, I myself always strive to have a conscience without offense_ toward God and men.

Again **2Tim1:3**_  __I thank God, whom I serve with a pure conscience, as my forefathers did, as_ without ceasing I remember you in my prayers night and day,

**1Thes2:10** _You are witnesses, and God also, how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we_ behaved ourselves among you who believe;

**Heb13:18** _Pray for us; for we are confident that we have a good conscience, in all things desiring to live honorably._

**2Thes3:9** but _to make ourselves an example of how you should follow us._

_**1Cor11:1**_ _Imitate me, just as I also imitate Christ._

**Luke1:6** _And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless._

The OT Testifies of Many Righteous Saints from Moses to Job, Daniel, Noah (Ezk14:14, Dan6:22) The Righteous people warned in Ezk18, The Righteous in Contrast to the Wicked all through Proverbs and Psalms. **DOING** what is Right by Faith is **EXACTLY** what the Truly Saved will do! Because those who sin are of the devil 1Jh3:8 & Are SLAVES to sin! Jh8:34

<u>If a Person has NOT</u> laid aside all filthiness and overflow of wickedness and received with meekness the implanted Word (that is able to save your soul!) he is **NOT** a Christian! (Js1:21) The Very Purpose of the Commandment Christ Delivered is 'Purity, <u>Sincerity and Love!' 1Tim1:5,</u> based on Matt22:37-40 Lord's own Words! If the Faith you claim to have in Jesus has not Truly PURIFIED your heart of Lust (flesh, eye, pride of life) you're DECEIVED!

<u>**The Charge of Sinless Perfection**</u> (of which every Saint sited above would be guilty of today) Anyone who promotes this kind of Devotion, loyalty and Purity of heart before God is instantly charged with Preaching <u>'Sinless Perfection'</u> and branded a hypocrite, accused of all manner of vile things.

If abstaining from the vile sins we are discussing here is being as Perfect as God then we can offer you no further explanation but such as we have from Bible Scripture .. Which of course you will counter with:

The Filthy Rags of Isa64:6, Desperately wicked heart of Jer17:9-10, Romans Wretch of Rom7:14 and Chief of Sinners of 1Tim1:15 (not to mention also 1Jh:8 and a few select passages from the OT)

Let me try and be honest with you here and appeal to your sense of reason. <u>NO ONE</u> can be or is Required to be as <u>PERFECT as GOD</u> in the Bible. We are required to '_Go and Sin no More!_' Jh5:14, 8:11. <u>Although we will</u> <u>**NEVER**</u>: Be Perfect in Knowledge, Free from Ignorance, Free from defects, Mistakes in Judgment, Or infirmity of the flesh.

<u>**HOWEVER we can Indeed**</u> '_Be Perfect as your heavenly Father is Perfect'_ Mt5:48, **BY:** Obedience to the Truth, 1Pet1:22, Walking in the Spirit, Rom8:1-4, Perfecting Holiness, 2Cor7:1, Holding fast in full confidence, Steadfast to the end, Heb3:3,14, Hungering & Thirsting after Righteousness, Mt5:6, Fearing and loving God & Hating Sin, Prov8:13, Ps97:10, Abstaining from every appearance of evil, 1Thes5:22, Keeping yourself Pure, 1Jh3:3, 5:18, 1Tim5:22, Keeping the body under, 1Cor9:27, Choosing to Do Good! Isa1:16-17

<u>NOW be honest with me</u> (if you will) DOES any of this Sound even remotely like what you believe and are being taught in the Churches about sinning daily in thought, word and deed? Is it<u>**EARNING**</u> your Salvation, Legalist Works, Self Justification, to <u>OBEY God</u> as directed above and abstain from Fleshly Lust? WHY Claim to have Repented of anything or even Have the Holy Spirit if you <u>Cannot</u> <u>STOP</u> Lusting after the World? 1Jh2:15-16

Nearly everyone today says they cannot Stop sinning until they have Received Jesus to help them. IF that were True WHY Does the Sin<u>**NEVER STOP**</u> And the Clean Up <u>NEVER Happen!?</u> You think that falling into Fornications, Drunkenness, adultery, perversions, uncleanness and filthiness of the flesh are just <u>Mistakes</u> God will forgive if you apologize, but never completely forsake. (since no one can according to the excuse of 1Jh1:8)

Therefore we Must Part Ways with the 'no <u>one is Perfect'</u> crowd because to them <u>'all</u> <u>sin is the same'</u> Filthiness, Uncleanness, fornication, Drunkenness is equal to a <u>Mistake</u> in Judgment or Wrong Decision, so in their eyes<u>**BY NECESSITY**</u> we MUST be Liars and filthy minded sinners . Just like them. Sins of Lust and uncleanness will Not Keep them OUT of the Kingdom, they can <u>SIN AND NOT DIE,</u> so their preachers have told them, because Jesus was their Moral & Perfect Substitute and Obeyed in their place to Pre-forgive their sins. It sounds to me like Satan has their ear; Gen3:4, '_You shall surely not die'_, Not God '_<u>Depart from Iniquity'</u>_ 2Tim2:19

<u>The Proverbs Constantly</u> tell us that a Person who hates instruction, knowledge, reproof, is wicked and Stupid. Paul said a time would come when People would no longer endure Sound Doctrine that promotes godly behavior and reproves sinners. (2Tim4:2-5) The Prophets warned of a time when people would <u>call good evil and evil good</u> Isa5:20. Such is what we see today among the Professed, to them abstaining from Vile sins of the flesh is being 100% Sinless and Unbelief is the ONLY Sin God will Judge to Hell!

As stated before man is a sinner by Choice NOT by Nature. By the constant misuse of his free will he has chosen evil rather than good and is now addicted to it. The very fallacies he uses to excuse himself before God have become his snare limiting his own natural Ability to TURN from sin and seek God in full determination, to find the Purity of heart through faith working by love.

<u>Let's look at Heb 10:26-31 as to what it means to Insult the Spirit of Grace:</u>

> _For if we sin willfully after we have received the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery indignation which will devour the adversaries. Anyone who has rejected Moses' law dies without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses. Of how much worse punishment, do you suppose, will he be thought worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, counted the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified a common thing,  <u>and insulted th#e Spirit of grace?</u>_

_**Heb10:26-29**_

You insult the Spirit of Grace by <u>Continuing in sin</u> **AFTER** you have been Redeemed by the Blood of Christ. The Free Gift of Grace was NOT given without purpose (in Vain). The Purpose of Grace is to Release men from the bondage of sin and Purify his heart of its corrupting influence. (Titus2:11-14, 1Pet1:22) Those 'saved' by Substitution think Grace is their magic cover and license to sin! (Jude3-4)

The reason professing people have such a difficult time with this passage is they do not understand the seriousness of falling back into vile sins of the flesh, mainly because they have never truly been saved to begin with. I know this is tough pill to swallow in the churches, seeing how sincere everyone claims to be, especially the pastors, but those supposedly saved under the<u>**Substitution System of error**</u> can HARDLY come to grips with the depths of delusion they have bought into by believing Jesus obeyed in their place and gave them His Righteousness. First of all this passage was written to people who had actually stopped sinning, been truly purged by the blood of Christ and had a<u>**full and complete knowledge**</u> of Redemption, Regeneration and Newness of life. The warning was given in order to show them the dire consequences of returning to the old life of sin and insulting the Spirit of Grace, by which they had been released from the bondage of sin. To them it was tantamount to trampling the Son of God underfoot and counting His **blood** as the **blood** of animals not able to take away sin! (Heb9:13) <u>Substitution Christians</u> have been taught concerning this passage that the people addressed were not yet saved (but only had head knowledge, much like the '_<u>faith alone'</u>_ crowd does now, but considers themselves truly saved) However if anyone in the Church takes this passage on face value alone it must **BY NECESSITY** be explained away some how, otherwise they are in BIG, BIG trouble with God for living the sin daily routine.

I can truthfully testify here that this passage and Heb6:1-8 have been a<u>**HUGE**</u><u>**source**</u> of concern to those awakened from the fallacy of Substitution and become instantaneously aware they are standing on the Very edge of the deepest depths of Perdition! Their hearts are pierced by the Sword of Truth for the first time in their lives and they are wholly convinced this means they have passed the <u>Point of no</u> <u>RETURN</u> like Esau. (Heb12:16-17) It's **VERY** difficult to almost impossible to persuade them this is a FIRST Repentance and everything prior to that was the dead works of religion. But finding that first repentance is the issue pressing in on their minds, because all they can see in their present Awakened State is the horror of God's Judgment looming over them.

When someone suddenly realizes they have been in the very **Depths of Satan** (sitting under and believing the sin everyday lies in the churches) they are finally able to fully grasp how callous their heart has become believing that sin 'Humbles' them instead of <u>hardened</u> them further like the scripture says; **Heb12:15** '_Looking_ diligently lest anyone fall short of the Grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up _cause trouble and by this many become defiled'_ (then they give the example of Esau) The Reality here is that NONE of this has ever been taught or even discussed in their Churches or by any of their favorite Bible Pundits, only to explain it away as to not apply to them.<u>**NOW**</u> they are seeing the icy stare of Death glaring into their wretched souls with eyes wide open and they are frightened out of their wits!

It's no wonder the Scripture says of those<u>**Truly Saved**</u> out of their sin and having fallen away, that it's <u>virtually</u> **IMPOSSIBLE** to restore them again to Repentance! Heb6:4\. They have Re-Crucified Christ and held Him up to open shame. These being people who had<u>**Actually**</u> been Enlightened, Tasted the heavenly gift and became Partakers of the Holy Spirit, not a Pack of sin everyday hypocrites hiding under the Magic Cloak! But that certainly doesn't let the Present Saved in Substitution Crowd off the hook for doing the exact same thing described here. How many times have they **Mocked** the Lord by asking the lame question 'How <u>many sins can I commit</u> <u>before losing my salvation'</u> (as though they had any real salvation to begin with!) or Constantly sighting King David as their excuse for continually falling into lust? Although sin has brought them nothing but misery on top of more misery and will finally be their ultimate downfall, they STILL believe that <u>ONE</u> <u>**RARE**</u> <u>Exception</u> thousands of years ago by a man who brought down an entire Kingdom in willful rebellion to God, is their ticket to Paradise!

The Scripture No Where tells us to expect a Restoration on the Scale of King David BUT it does tell us to:<u>**REMEMBER LOT'S WIFE!!!**</u> Lk17:32\. Your disposition toward sin reveals your Divided Loyalty. If you Loved God you would Hate Sin and CEASE from it. (1Pet4:1, PS97:10) But in your Deception you've been Blinded to the truth! (you cannot even perceive the warnings in Hebrews until you have been truly **Illuminated** by God)

<u>**Very FEW**</u> in the Substitution lie (sin everyday myth) will ever find it within themselves and come to grips with the severity of their situation. They have Mocked God and **Shamed** themselves for so long that its almost second natured to argue for sin and condemn anyone who tells them otherwise. They have Trampled His offer of Grace underfoot and counted His redeeming Blood as powerless to Release them from the bondage of sin. Truly there remains only  <u>a fiery indignation that will devour the adversaries!</u>

In essence belief in the filthy rags, wretched model of Salvation has caused people to shake their fists in God's face for demanding they **DEPART** from Iniquity in order to enter His Kingdom. They have wallowed with impunity over an extensive period of time and now their minds are Given over to the Strong Delusion of Satan. (believing all the time they are in the Light!)  <u>Ignorantly you have fallen prey to Calling evil good and good evil,</u> Isa5:20, _You have wearied the LORD with your words; Yet you say, "In_ what way have we wearied Him?" In that you say, "Everyone who does evil Is good in the _sight of the LORD, And He delights in them," Or, "Where is the God of justice?"_ Malachi2:17

**In TRUTH** isn't this exactly what they are Doing? They call the Righteous lying hypocrites and condemn them to hell, while those who dwell in the filthy rags of their iniquity are Saved by His Grace! <u>WHAT remains to be said? They cannot see</u> <u>the Obvious Truth:</u> _The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul; The testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple; The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart; The commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes; The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring forever; The judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether_ _**Ps19:7-9**_

You cannot Willfully Sin against Grace without Dire Consequences. Those Truly <u>Regenerated from Darkness to Light, from the Power of Satan to God,</u> understand this warning. You DO NOT have impunity with God! But the Saved in Sin Crowd will never get it, to them there are no Deeds of Righteousness done in Faith working by Love, only a fictitious belief that they can **'SIN AND NOT DIE!'** But WILL they escape the Judgment of God?

> _Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. Though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and his days are prolonged, yet I surely know that it will be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him. But it will not be well with the wicked; nor will he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he does not fear before God._

_**Ecc8:11-13**_

<u>**Is a Person accounted Righteous in his sins**</u>? According to the Substitution Doctrine Rom4:1-8 teaches that a man can be declared Righteous (apart from works) while still in his sins. <u>BUT David Clarifies the issue in PS32:1-2</u> as a Man who has Bitterly Repented of his transgressions and been cleansed in the Blood through his repentance and faith proven by deeds. (the deeds evident are: forsaking further transgression & coming Clean with God!) That's the **STEPS** of faith by which a person emulates Father Abraham in Rom4:12\. **READ** David's Psalms Does it say **ANYWHERE** a man can continue in sin and be Justified?

> _<u>Depart from evil, and do good;</u> And dwell forevermore. For the LORD loves justice, And does not forsake His saints; They are preserved forever, But the descendants of the wicked shall be cut off. The righteous shall inherit the land, And dwell in it forever._

_**Ps37:27-29**_

It's absolutely disgusting that many preachers will condemn certain types of sins over others (like homosexuality or lesbianism) while they insist to the 'saved in sin' crowd that all sins are the same and God Justifies them in their sin, but they will cringe at the thought of gays professing to be Christians. This is <u>blatant Hypocrisy!</u> If the fornicator, adulterer, drunkard and men with eyes full of lust are <u>SAVED</u> (and waiting for God to clean them up) HOW can you expect anyone (even the child molesters!) to take your Gospel seriously enough to STOP doing anything!? Isn't it time to **FESS UP** to your Phony Christianity and face the Truth? The Sins you condemn and the sins you condone will <u>ALL Disqualify</u> you from the Kingdom! God is **NOT** going to play favorites with such things as 1Cor6:9-10, Gal5:19-21.


## 6. Regeneration in Christ

> _For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, deceived, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful and hating one another. But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared, not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the <u>washing of regeneration</u> <u>and renewing of the Holy Spirit,</u> whom He poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior, that having been justified by His grace we should become heirs according to the hope of eternal life._

_**Titus 3:3-7**_

The Saved in sin, sin everyday crowd knows nothing of this renewing. They have accepted a Provision that provides nothing dynamic or life changing, only a magic Cover for their sins, but inside they remain vile to the core as before they 'received' Jesus. In the passage above being Justified by His Grace has also brought about a 'washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit', the body of sin is no longer an issue! The bondage is broken. Grace sets us Free in this Present age! Titus2:11-14

<u>**Regeneration (New Birth) is Translated as the following:**</u>

_new birth, reproduction, renewal, recreation, regeneration_

Hence renovation, regeneration, the production of a new life consecrated to God, a radical change of mind for the better. The word often used to denote the restoration of a thing to its pristine state, its renovation, as a renewal or restoration of life after death the renovation of the earth after the deluge the renewal of the world to take place after its destruction by fire, the New Heaven and new earth where Righteousness dwells! 2Pet3:13

**Renewing Means**: a renewal, renovation, complete change for the better, as in Rom12:1-2 'Transformed by the renewing of your Mind!'If then a person has been Regenerated and Renewed by the Spirit through Repentance and faith Proven by deeds. (2Cor7:10-11) The **WORD** itself (Logos, Christ incarnate) has WASHED them from the inside out!

_'that He might sanctify and cleanse her with the <u>washing of water by the word'</u> **Eph5:26**_

_You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you. **Jh15:3**_

WHY were they CLEAN? Because you **PURIFY** your Heart BY Obedience to the Truth! 1Pet1:22 (in faith working by love.)

This wonderful Regeneration and Renewal takes place AFTER a person has Crucified the flesh with its Passions and Desires (Gal5:24) in the Baptism of Repentance, Rom6:4-7 (Mk1:4, Lk3:2, Acts13:24, 19:4)

> _Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life. For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we also shall be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old man was crucified with Him, that the body of sin might be done away with, that we should no longer be slaves of sin. For he who has died has been freed from sin._

**<u>The END Result of Repentance then is:</u>**

- Body of Sin Done away with

- Old man Crucified

- No Longer Slave to sin, But FREED from Sin!

- Purity of Heart! 2Cor7:11

It was<u>**OBEDIENCE from the Heart**</u> that Delivered you to this Marvelous Regeneration & Renewal: **Rom6:16** '_But God be thanked that though you were Slaves to sin, yet you OBEYED from the_ heart that form of Doctrine to which you were DELIEVERED!'

<u>NOW ask yourself an honest question:</u> "HOW can you still be the Chief of sinners, Romans Wretch with a Desperately Wicked heart who sins daily in thought, word and deed and have actually experienced this kind of **RENEWAL**?"

Something is **DESPERATELY** Wrong with your Supposed Salvation experience if NONE of this is present in your life now. Read the Passages again, Does any of it sound like this is some kind of Gradual process of sin, repent, sin repent for the rest of your life?

In the Rom12:1-2 Passage it says '**Be TRANSFORMED'** by the Renewing of your Mind. This word is<u>**Metamorphoses**</u>, its what happened to Christ in the Transfiguration! (Matt17:2) So it would stand to Reason that the Regeneration of the Holy Spirit is also an instantaneous Metamorphosis of the Mind and spirit of man! That means the Bondage to Sin is broken the Mind is Cleansed and Purged of Lust and your entire Disposition is Changed. Isn't that the Promise made by God through His Promises:

> _as His divine power has given to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by glory and virtue, by which have been given to us exceedingly great and precious promises, that through these you may be partakers of the divine nature, having **escaped** the corruption that is in the world through lust._

_**2Pet1:3-4**_

Partakers of the DIVINE Nature to ESCAPE the Corrupting influence of Lust! How can a person remain in bondage to lust and evil dispositions of the flesh (sold under sin, Rom7:14) and 'have <u>escaped'</u> it at the same time? Does that make sense to you? Is the Word of God merely saying these things to Mock us as we wallow in our sin and claim Salvation in Christ? I Don't think so.

Those who Desire the Living Waters of Christ will come and Seek out this Regeneration and FIND it! But those who dream on that a person can be 'of Christ' and still be addicted to Sin will end up with nothing.

> _And the Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" And let him who hears say, "Come!" And let him who thirsts come. Whoever desires, let him take the water of life freely._

_**Rev22:17**_

_**THIS is the Living Water that will Wash, Purify and Regenerate your Soul from all that is vile and corrupt. COME!**_

<u>**Heb 11:6 'God Rewards those who Diligently Seek Him!'**</u>

A Determined effort to Seek Him out, Ask, Seek, Knock. Hunger, STRIVE, with a Vehement Desire, and purpose of human will.

<u>Take the Kingdom by Force! Matt11:12</u>

You Find True Repentance by Breaking up the fallow ground of your heart, Jer4:3, Hos10:12_. Sow for yourselves righteousness; Reap in mercy; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the LORD, Till He comes and rains righteousness on you._ It's a Good and HONEST heart that Receives the Word where it can take root and produces a Harvest of Righteousness. Lk8:15 _But the ones that fell on the good ground are those who, having heard the word with a noble and good heart, keep it and bear fruit with patience._

Christ will Never be found through Church Traditions, formulas, Repeating words, or accepting some notion that He obeyed in your place and transferred His Perfect Righteousness to you. The indulgences of the flesh are brought to naught in genuine Regeneration in Christ, NOT in submitting yourself to useless rituals in an attempt to subdue the indulgences of the flesh.

> _Therefore, if you died with Christ from the basic principles of the world, why, as though living in the world, do you subject yourselves to regulations "Do not touch, do not taste, do not handle," which all concern things which perish with the using—according to the commandments and doctrines of men? These things indeed have an appearance of wisdom in self-imposed religion, false humility, and neglect of the body, but are of no value against the indulgence of the flesh._

_**Col2:20-23**_


## 7. What the fallacy of Penal Substitution has done to the Gospel

The Redemption Model universally accepted by the Orthodox Church for over 1000 years was based on Ransom in which Christ died on behalf of man to Redeem him from the Corrupting influence of sin; through repentance and faith PROVEN by Deeds. (No magic transfer of sin or righteousness, Redemption depended on Obedience to the truth, 'Faith & Deeds)

Around the 11th Century a Catholic Bishop named Anselm developed the <u>**Satisfaction theory**</u>, in which Christ suffered as a Substitute on behalf of mankind in order to appease God's sense of Justice, balancing out the scales so to speak; so God's Divine authority would not be defrauded. Christ **did not** have to suffer the Wrath of God or be blackened as a sinner, but He did have to <u>'Satisfy'</u> Divine Justice to make restitution for the wrongs man had done to God. This theory was later expanded by another Bishop named Abelard around 1100AD and much later severely altered into a <u>Penal Model</u> by Thomas Aquinas around 1200AD. In this was the Demise of Genuine Repentance Proven by Deeds, since Christ was man's Substitute (under these theories) a person had but merely to TRUST in His Satisfaction (or Provision) and be declared Saved in God's sight.

The final and most devastating blow to the Gospel of Christ came about in the 1500's when the Satisfaction Model was systematized (or standardize) into a diabolical perversion called: **'Penal**<u> **Substitution'**</u>, by heretics Martin Luther in Germany and John Calvin in Geneva. (I accuse them of heresy because historically they participated in murder, torture and other heinous acts not conducive to Christ's teachings) _**Penal**_ inserts the idea of 'Punishment' and changes the focus of Christ's sacrifice from <u>Redemption to PAYMENT.</u> He actually had to BECOME a Sinner and Suffer man's penalty on the Cross in order to appease the awful Wrath of God (the vengeful Judge who demanded blood)

Throughout the 1500-1800's the Reformers wavered between Anselm's Satisfaction theory and Luther-Calvin's Penal Model which turned Divine Justice into a Court of law where God had to Punish an innocent person to conciliate Himself against the sins of man and establish a PROVSION to mystically Transfer Righteousness to him while he remained still in his sins.

<u>**To Clarify between the two models:**</u>

Satisfaction is seen as an Alternative to Punishment so God's honor can be restored.

In Penal Satisfaction the Punishment (Wrath) Satisfies the Demand for Justice

Thus we have Bible Ransom vs. two models of Satisfaction invented by men.

The Bible says Christ died on man's<u>**BEHALF**</u> (_hyper_ in the Greek, 1Tim2:6, Mt20:28, Mk10:45) Satisfaction claims He died in our<u>**STEAD**</u> (_anti_ in Greek, Rom12:17, 1Thes5:15, as in 'instead' of returning evil for evil, return it with good)

<u>Splitting hairs you say? I don't think so.</u> If Christ died on our Behalf (to redeem us from the corruption of sin) then we are obligated to<u>**FOLLOW**</u> Him in Obedient devotion to His teachings. (Directly in line with the Bible: Mt10:34-39, Mk9:34-38, Lk9:23-27, 1Pet2:21)

If however you believe that He died in your place as a Substitute then your obedience and righteousness is fulfilled in the <u>PROVISION</u> He made as your replacement. So you have the Moral Transfer, Pre-forgiveness of sin and the Magic cover of Grace. A neat little Package all wrapped up in repeat after me!

<u>**Today**</u> the vast majority of Professed Christians world wide have come into the faith in this manner; believing that Christ is their recompense against any further judgment for their on-going sins. They are wholly ignorant of the historical origin of the Satisfaction doctrine and how it necessitates the System of error preached as Bible Truth in all facets of church life today.

The major Bible Pundits have crafted these errors to near perfection making them feasible in the minds of men in accordance to their twisted understanding of Scripture. Their success can be seen in sordid and shameful condition of people supposedly being 'saved' under such preaching. <u>Ransom,</u> as presented in the Bible by Christ Himself, is a foreign concept among the professed. They cannot comprehend a Savior who demands their entire obedience and a denial of self life. To them there is simply no Purpose to His Death if it wasn't to Provide them with a means to be 'saved' in their sins; otherwise no one can be Saved because no one can ever Stop sinning.

**<u>What makes Penal Substitution anti-Bible?</u>**

<u>**First**</u> because it absolutely negates the necessity of Crucifying the flesh with its passions and desires in the process of Repentance proven by deeds called for in Scripture. (Mt3:8, Mk3:8, Acts26:18-20) Therefore the vile sins of the flesh NEVER stop & the heart can never be Pure by faith working by love. (Rom6:4-6, Gal5:24, Acts15:9, 1Pet1:22)

<u>**Second**</u> because it turns the Precious Savior into a Blackened Sinner by some mystical transfer in God's mind so He could be Punished and man be declared righteous while he remains un-righteous.

<u>**Third**</u> it subjects the Blameless and Pure Savior with no sin in Him (1Jh3:5) to the full force of God's Wrath in some kind of Divine vengeance to punish the innocent in place of the guilty. The exact opposite of Mercy! (Isa55:7, Js2:13)

**<u>To Summarize what all this means in light of Salvation:</u>**

Man is <u>Provided</u> with a means to be 'Saved <u>in his sins'</u> because he is Born with a 'sinful <u>nature'</u> inherited from Adam of which he cannot forsake (you can't forsake a nature) but MUST be Covered from God's sight so he can be declared worthy of heaven even though he can never completely Stop sinning in this life. Thus the **Substitution** is his Salvation by <u>receiving</u> Christ into his heart and trusting it is finished, sin is pre-forgiven and Wrath fully satisfied.

**<u>In this is the BEDROCK of every nonsensical fallacy on the lips of Professing</u> <u>Christians today:</u>**

'No one can ever stop sinning', 'If they could stop they wouldn't need Jesus and could save themselves', 'If I claim to do Righteous deeds I am trying to Self Justify and therefore Self-Righteous', 'If I add Works or Deeds to my faith I am rejecting Grace and destine for Perdition', and IF I say I have no Sin I lie and the truth is NOT in me!'

<u>Therefore the Bible Pundits teach that 'Christians' are:</u> 'The Chief of sinners, Romans Wretch, with a Desperately Wicked heart full of filthy rags, who sin daily in thought, word and deed and anyone who claims otherwise is a self righteous liar with no truth in them.' Iron Clad Deception guaranteed to seal your doom to Perdition!

<u>**So there you have it Penal Substitution:**</u>=

- Pre-forgives sin, past, present and future

- Turns Christ into a Sinner who is punished in man's place

- Invents a Mystical Double Transfer of Sin and Righteousness

- Creates a FULL Provision for Continuing in sin without fear of penalty

- And **Negates** the Entire Purpose of the **GOSPEL** to Redeem man from the Corrupting influence of sin!

<u>ALL OPPOSITE OF THE BIBLE!</u>

<u>Christ died on Behalf of man as a Ransom for sin to Release him from bondage and</u> <u>destroy the works of the devil</u>

_who gave Himself a **ransom** for all, to be testified in due time **1Tim2:6**. (see also Matt20:28, Mk10:45, Isa52:3, Hosea13:14)_

> _He who sins is of the devil, for the devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was manifested, that He might destroy the works of the devil. **1Jh3:8**_

**<u>He Could NOT have become Sin, because there was NO Sin in Him, He was a sin offering, not sin!</u>**

> _And you know that He was manifested to take away our sins, and <u>in Him there is no sin.1Jh3:5</u>_

> _how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit <u>offered Himself</u> <u>without spot to God,</u> cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?_

_**Heb9:14**_

> _Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise Him; He has put Him to grief. When You make His soul an <u>offering for sin,</u> **Isa53:10**_

<u>**Righteous is What you DO by Faith Working by Love!**</u> <u>(It cannot be transferred)</u>

> _Little children, let no man deceive you: he that does what is right is righteous, even as he is righteous. **1Jh3:8**_

> _For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, but faith working through love. **Gal5:6**_

> _By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out, Heb11:8, 'Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit in sincere love of the brethren, love one another fervently with a pure heart,' **1Pet1:22**_

<u>**It's Not Provision but REPENTANCE Proven by Deeds to .....**</u>

> _<u>to open their eyes, in order to turn them from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God,</u> that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.' Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, but declared first to those in Damascus and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent, turn to God, and<u>**do works** </u><u>befitting repentance</u>_

_**Acts26:18-20**_

<u>Under Substitution:</u>

- (Born in sin, saved in sin, stay in sin)

- The Sin Never Stops even with Christ

- You remain Carnal Sold under sin, no purity of heart

- The Flesh is Never Crucified with Christ in Repentance

- Faith is never a work of love purifying the heart of sin

- There is no fear or urgency to get free from wrong doing

- The Professed is Dead to God

<u>Under Ransom, Bible Redemption:</u>

- Released from the bondage and corruption of sin

- Faith is working by love, purifying the heart of sin & having Victory over the world

- The Passions and Desires are Crucified with Christ, body of sin destroyed

- The eyes of the understanding are open illuminated by Truth

- The spirit is Renewed, transformed and diligently following Christ

<u>**Substitution is a Doctrine of Demons**</u> and has (for the most part) ruined Gospel Preaching in the World today! As a result Millions now Walk blindly down the Wide Road to Perdition wholly unaware of their approaching doom. We Must work Diligently to Pull Down this horrible Doctrine to save some before it's too late.

> _For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty in God<u>**for pulling down strongholds**</u>, casting down arguments and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, bringing every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, and being ready to punish all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled._

_**2Cor10:3-6**_


## 8. The Church as it is seen today compared to the Ekklesia of Scripture

_<u>**Ekklēsia**</u>_ is the Greek word used in the New Testament over 116 times, translated in our English Bibles as 'Church'. The word has NOTHING to do with stone buildings or sacred places of worship. It is a compound word meaning: 'Ek': Out from; 'Ekklēsia' the called out. Thus the 'Called out'.

The Greek word most closely related to 'Church' is _**kuriakos**_, used in 1Cor11:20 & Rev1:10, translated: 'the Lord's' as referring to the Lord's Supper and the Lord's Day. <u>Meaning in the Greek:</u> belonging to the Lord, related to the Lord. This word became associated with places of 'Christian' worship around 300AD under Roman Emperor Constantine. Up to that time the true followers of Jesus Christ were meeting in private homes, often in secret at night. **WHY?** Because in the Roman Empire there could be no private religion. It was against the law and considered conspiratorial to hold secret or private meetings in homes. This is why the Pagans often brought moral charges against the Christians accusing them of incest, cannibalism and unnatural practices. Scripture records the meetings in homes: Rom16:5, 1Cor16:19, Col4:15, Phil1:2, Acts2:46

<u>**Christ Intended Church Matt16:13-19**</u>

> _When Jesus came into the region of Caesarea Philippi, He asked His disciples, saying, "Who do men say that I, the Son of Man, am?" So they said, "Some say John the Baptist, some Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets." He said to them, "But who do you say that I am?" Simon Peter answered and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Jesus answered and said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in heaven. And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build<u>**My church**</u>, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it. And I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven."_

What is the Lord referring to? Its Certainly NOT a building considered 'Sacred' where the Lord dwells. His Spirit does not reside in things made of stone and wood. When He told His Disciples that if '_Anyone love Me, he will Keep My Word and My Father will love him and WE will come to him and make Our home with him'_ Jn14:23, He was speaking of this _**'Ekklēsia'**_ of the 'Called <u>out ones'.</u> These would be His **assembly** called out of Darkness and Bondage into Light and Freedom from sin! (Acts26:18) The Saints are NOT called to buildings set apart as sacred run by a religious establishment of clergy with some kind of special privileges to Lord over people.<u>**WHO is Greatest in the Kingdom of our Lord?**</u>

> _And whoever desires to be first among you, let him be your servant. **Matt20:27**_

> _But he who is greatest among you shall be your servant. **Matt23:11**_

<u>**Even the Ransom**</u> (redemption of Christ) is associated with this kind of Servitude: _just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom_ for many."_**Matt20:28**_

Jesus as the **'ROCK'** 1Cor10:4 (_Petra_, up on which the _**Ekklēsia**_ is to be Established) Served on the 'Called <u>out ones'</u> behalf in order to Redeem them from darkness to light from the power of Satan to God. That's why His 'Church' is the 'Chosen <u>generation,</u> the Royal priesthood, a holy nation of His own special people that may proclaim praises to Him who called them out of darkness into His marvelous Light!' 1Pet2:9\. The _**Ekklēsia**_ is NOT the filthy ragged, desperately wicked, wretched, born depraved, chiefs of sinners sitting under the bondage of a religious system that rules over their minds and keeps them in ignorance.

Peter's (_petros_, small rock) confession stands as the testimony of the _**Ekklesia's** _foundation on which the Saints are to build; **1Cor3:9-11** _For we are God's fellow_ workers; you are God's field, you are God's building. According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation, and another builds on _it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.__ <u>For no other foundation can anyone lay</u>__<u>than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ!</u>_ Understanding that it's GOD who gives the increase, 1Cor3:7\. This is why His Saints stand out as 'Special People' (unique 1Pet2:9) His Bride who has made themselves ready for His coming, Rev19:7, going forth into all the earth to proclaim the riches of His Glory, (Eph1:18, 3:16, Rom9:23) endued with the Power from on High! Acts1:8. Professing Christians in the Church System do not have a clue what it means to be among the 'called <u>out'</u> ones. They have yet to answer the call to _'Come__ <u>Out from among them and be separate'</u>_ <u>2Cor6:16-18.</u> Separate from what, they will ask, we are the Church! (yes, but not the _Ekklesia_)

The Satanic distortion of '<u>**Church**</u>' began in forth Century Rome under Emperor Constantine who granted religious tolerance in the land that brought an end to the bitter persecutions against Christians. This eventually led to the uniting of church and state, bringing the 'Christians' into the great cathedrals of Rome. (considered sacred by the pagans) From that time forward an <u>'Official'</u> religious system existed under the guise of Christianity blending together the idols, pagan beliefs and rituals of Roman culture and remains so to this day. To the officials of Rome you were either a 'Catholic <u>Christian'</u> or a <u>'heretic'.branded</u> foolish madmen, who should suffer chastisement and divine condemnation.

Essentially this turned the tables against the real Saints of God labeling them dangerous dissenters and who would not bow to the authority of Rome. The Ecclesiastical System had full authority to persecute and legally murder their religious opponents who opposed them. Sparing you the long and bloody history of religious tyranny that brought us the horror of Crusades, Inquisitions, torture and massive persecutions throughout history to present day, suffice to say the '**CHURCH**' as we know it in our current society has<u>**NOTHING**</u> to do with CHRIST! Certainly much of the bitter persecution has ceased in our 'relativity' free country and we are currently permitted to practice the religion of our choice, it doesn't negate the **FACT** that the existing Religious Establishment of professing Christianity in the free world is still **Pagan** based to its core.

The '**Churches**' as they exist in our towns, villages and cities, in which so-called Christians claim to worship the One True God are simply an off-shoot of what happened in ancient Rome when the Pure Doctrine of Jesus Christ was nullified by the teachings of men. This is why the 'Church' has absolutely no similarity to the '_**Ekklēsia**_' of the Bible and also has no desire whatsoever to resemble it. They have their<u>**SYSTEM**</u> in place that serves the purpose of gathering humanity under a unified pattern of religion where anything goes and people can choose the 'form' that suits them best.

The establishment can still maintain a fabricated authority over attendees insisting they must submit to church leadership and remain in fellowship lest they abandon the faith. This enforces the fantasy in the minds of church goers that those who flee the System are angry runagates and devils better off gone rather than stirring up trouble in their midst. In olden times the 'Church' exercised domination over the people by the pretense of piety, the place of worship (they controlled) was consecrated of the Lord and dare not be blasphemed or defied. They may not be hunting down dissidents or burning anyone at the stake in our time, but TRY going among them to challenge their false doctrines and expose the sin! You will find out very quickly that non-compliance will NOT be tolerated.

A denominational church will use its entire governing body to see that you're silenced and cast out of doors if necessary. More independent organizations will muster the governing board against you and see that you're brought to shame in the eyes of the people. How different is that from <u>excommunication</u> or being branded a heretic by the religious establishment? The illegitimate 'Church' System STILL holds great sway over the gullible (professed) Christian public who fear being numbered among the rebellious. God's greatest Prophets (including John the Baptist) always stood aloof of the religious system and were greatly out-numbered by the dominant forces. Elijah had to stand alone against 450 false prophets of Baal who had already gone out and slain hundreds of the Lord's faithful. (1Kings19:12-21)

It's really no surprise that those of us who Preach the Lord's true Doctrine cannot buy or sell inside the religious system. (Rev13:17) The use of these words; '**Buy & Sell'** in Revelation 13 are <u>metaphorical.</u> To **Buy** means the ability to Participate in a market place.To **Sell** translates as ability to Barter in a place. Are God's true Messengers of Repentance and Faith Proven by deeds permitted to 'Participate' in the designated places of worship? Can they 'Barter' (the act or practice of carrying on a trade) among the 'church' people? <u>BY NO MEANS..because</u> they have NOT taken on the Mark (which is the lust of the eye, flesh & pride of life!) but have **CAST** it away in the Crucifixion of the passions and desires of the flesh. (Rom6:4-6,Gal5:24)

That's what has separated the '_**Ekklesia**_' from the church since the beginning. When Saul (later Paul) made havoc of the church entering into every house dragging off men and women committing them to prison (Acts8:3) Obviously he was finding this _**'Ekklesia'**_ in the houses. He did not have to seek them out in the local synagogues or other official places of worship approved by the religious system. And the **SAME** holds true today.you will **NOT** find the 'Called <u>out ones'</u> partaking at the table of demons in a place of idolatry. (1Cor10:21, 2Cor6:14-16)

We see this in Christ rolling back the vale of eternity in Matt7:21-23, when He pronounces those awful words to the people who thought they were serving Him in the false System, "_I Never Knew you, Depart from Me you workers of iniquity'!_ They participated in the rituals and traditions of the 'church', but never came out of their sins. They had not DEPARTED from iniquity. (2Tim2:19)

If we look back over the centuries of religious bondage since the days of ancient Rome, we find a ruling elite arrogantly reigning over the mind's of men by the use of <u>superstition</u> and the fear of a <u>vengeful God.</u> In darker times the mere suggestion that you were involved in anything the church deemed blasphemy it meant banishment from common society. (and often times death by horrible means) The average people could not simply ignore the ecclesiastical influence of the establishment because they had power to brandish the full power of the State against anyone who opposed them. So unless you were willing to contest a standing army that thoroughly enjoyed bloody slaughter, you kowtowed to the System in spite of your convictions.

Of course things have changed somewhat since the advent of Liberty in the world, but billions still live under authoritarian style leadership. The major difference today is that the 'Christian' <u>Church</u> is no longer a threat to the darkened authorities. Therefore if it, as an organization, is willing to exist within the parameters of state control it can enjoy full acceptance. (even in places like China) However private gatherings or (in house) churches are still considered a danger by most regimes because they operate apart from the supervision of prying eyes. This includes America, where many of the brain dead mind controlled, still believe their leaders respect the Bill of Rights. The general public, among who most professing Christians reside are already good minions of the State and subordinate to some form of authorized religious authority. The religious systems of history have provided man with a sanctuary for his 'sickness' of mind called the **'church**'. They have gone to extreme lengths to preserve this safe harbor for carnality, including the use of torture, coercion and deceptions.

Even when the vast monopoly of the Catholic System was challenged during what historians call the Reformation, the duplicity continued. When the Bible was finally authorized to be translated into English by King James VI in 1604, the 'esteemed' translators were instructed to rigorously maintain the Episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an 'ordained' <u>clergy.</u> So the Word '_<u>**Ekklesia**</u>_**'** in the Greek text was ordered to be translated 'Church'! (as it also appeared in the Geneva Bible the Anglo-Catholic Bishop's Bible) Thus it has been to this day. The 'Church' is still considered a sacred gathering place for 'Christians' and the clergy keeps the people in a state of ignorance and bliss. However GOD did not intend that His _**Ekklesia**_ to become an institutionalized religion.

We have already established that the 'Church' as it exists in America today is NOT the '<u>**Called out'**</u> ones of Christ. Further evidence of this is seen in their eagerness to obey the rules of State and operate within the constraints of a charitable origination. Since the founding of America the 'Churches' have been exempt (for the most part) from paying any taxes. (except on payroll earnings stating in the late 1930's) However as the Gospel became more and more secular in nature the government recognized its opportunity to weasel into 'religious' affairs by 'granting' them a special status under law to maintain their exemption. However nothing comes from government without strings attached and the American Church System was a prime candidate to 'sign <u>on'</u> to something they 'thought' was to their advantage. And in a bizarre sort of way the 501 (c) 3 charitable corporate tax exempt statuses (introduced in 1954) corresponds seamlessly into their counterfeit gospel message that follows the Great Harlot of Babylon.

This type of tax exemption turns the churches into <u>'corporations',</u> that must follow the guidelines (as any government granted corporation) stipulated in the agreement. Which means that in order to maintain a tax exempt status the Churches (and any charitable organization) must forego certain activities which are specifically: engaging in political lobbying or campaigning. That means the Pastors or other church leadership cannot endorse a candidate for political office or participate in any political debate that may influence the outcome of an election or the passing of legislation. Essentially this hamstrings the 'Churches' ability to act as any kind of a moral compass in society at large.

So there you have it! Your precious constitution brought to naught. Congress making no law respecting the establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. Has virtually no further significance in the land of the free. Not only have the Churches voluntarily repudiated the Gospel of Christ they have enthusiastically gone in league with the devil! They are a sort of 'Judas' <u>goat,</u> selling out for their thirty pieces of silver. They ride the **Scarlet Beast** of Rev17:3-6, adorn with all the trimmings of ancient Babylon.

As throughout their long and sorted history as a religious hierarchy they have always been FULLY aware of the control they are able to put forth over men AND used it to their complete advantage. With the 501 they can further demonize the runagates that refuse to comply and then wrap themselves in the flag as loyal patriots thereby garnering an even greater creditability to the unsuspecting masses who equate God and Country to the Bible. Is it of any wonder why Solomon said that there is nothing new under the sun? This same type of Mind control has been going on from the very dawn of creation. Man is a creature easily duped (or shall I say Doped) by the <u>Luciferian agenda</u> of instant gratification and the promise of supremacy. Thus you have the SAME establishment today as those who crucified Christ. Controlled in Mind and Heart by Satan himself!

> _Hearing you will hear and shall not understand, And seeing you will see and not perceive; For the hearts of this people have grown dull .Their ears are hard of hearing, And their eyes they have closed, Lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears, Lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, <u>So that I should heal them.</u> **Matt13:14-15**_

The _**Ekklēsia**_ can never be connected with a System, by definition they are the '<u>**called out'**</u> ones, Separate from the lust of the flesh, eyes and pride of life; all the trapping of the world the establishment churches find irresistible. They are His **Sheep** who hear His Voice and Obey, sojourns in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom they **SHINE** as Lights in a world of Darkness, Holding fast the Word of Life! Phil2:15-16

The religious systems of history have always provided man with a sanctuary for his carnality, concealing it with rituals and traditions designed to 'absolve' them of their responsibility to Obey God and come clean in Repentance. If it means that the religious authorities have to conspire together for an 'authorized' translation to maintain their 'appearance' of a consecrated institution of worship, then so be it. The unsuspecting masses will hardly notice the obvious inconsistency with the Bible. 'Church' is still considered the 'sacred' gathering place of 'Christians' on earth and the clergy recognized as the purveyors of truth. Today their mythology is Deception and imagery. In the past torture, coercion, superstitions and fear was their mode of operation. But since ancient Rome the 'Church' has been the source of fallacy and error brought about by blending Pagan doctrines with the Word of God.

However GOD did not intend that His _**Ekklēsia**_ to become an institutionalized religion. They are the Holy remnant 'called out' of darkness into the Light of His Truth to offer up an acceptable sacrifice of Praise as a sweet smelling aroma unto the Lord. (Heb12:28, Phil4:18) Flee from Babylon before it's too late; Come Out of her, don't 'hang out' with her!

> _And I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come <u>out of her, my people, lest you share</u> <u>in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues.</u> For her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities. Render to her just as she rendered to you, and repay her double according to her works; in the cup which she has mixed, mix double for her. In the measure that she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, in the same measure give her torment and sorrow; for she says in her heart, 'I sit as queen, and am no widow, and will not see sorrow.' Therefore her plagues will come in one day—death and mourning and famine. And she will be utterly burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who judges her._

_**Rev18:4-8**_


## 9. Legitimizing the Illegitimate Church!

The Professing Christian 'Church' is a hallow imitation of Christ's _**Ekklesia**_ of 'called out ones'. In their attempts to legitimize the blatantly illegitimate establishment church the concept of the visible and invisible church was invented. The '<u>**Visible'**</u>being the institutionalized body on earth that preaches the Gospel and administers the sacraments and the '<u>**invisible**</u>' body of 'ELECT' known only unto God.

This concept was first brought to light by Augustine in ancient Rome, (during which time the Empire had legalized Christianity and incorporated it into the pagan temples) taken from the Platonist theory of forms; which states that all true reality is invisible and only reflects the visible partially and imperfectly. (pagan non-sense) This carried into the Protestant Reformation in that the reformers insisted on distinguishing between the 'visible' Roman Catholic Church which was thoroughly corrupted and the 'true <u>believers'</u> paired off into their various denominations.

John Calvin loved this concept in that it blended perfectly into his erroneous system of election and reprobation. Since in his twisted mind God has 'chosen' from the foundation of the world those who would be 'elect' and those who would be condemned. This idea of a 'church <u>within the Church'</u> spread throughout professing Christianity because it was the perfect method to legitimize the established System and excuse the obvious presence of the Tares among the Wheat.

Thus the argument that Christ qualified this concept in His Parable of the Wheat and Tares, given in Matt13:24-30, 37-43\. (although the use of the specific words; visible and invisible cannot be found in reference to the _**Ekklesia**_) The Parable reads:

> _Another parable He put forth to them, saying: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field; but while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way. But when the grain had sprouted and produced a crop, then the tares also appeared. So the servants of the owner came and said to him, 'Sir, <u>did you not sow</u> <u>good seed in your field? How then does it have tares?'</u> He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' The servants said to him, 'Do you want us then to go and gather them up?' But he said, 'No, lest while you gather up the tares you also uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest, and at the time of harvest I will say to the reapers, "First gather together the tares and bind them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my barn._

The first major discrepancy in the <u>'invisible'</u> concept is that the True Servants of the Lord <u>IMMEDIATELY</u> recognize the presence Tares among the Wheat. They did not acquiesce to 'exist' together with them. The reason the Lord directed them to refrain from gathering up the Tares at the moment is that the **FIELD** represented the <u>WORLD,</u> NOT the Church! Heed His very Words: 

> _He who sows the good seed is the Son of Man.<u>**The field is the world**</u>, the good seeds are the sons of the kingdom, but the tares are the sons of the wicked one. The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels. Therefore as the tares are gathered and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of this age. The Son of Man will send out His angels, and they will gather out of His kingdom all things that offend, and those who practice lawlessness, and will cast them into the furnace of fire. There will be wailing and gnashing of teeth. Then the righteous will shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear!_

This is much the same as the Parable of the Sower (Mt13:18-23) The **SEED** (Word of God) is Sown into the World at large, along the wayside, among thorns and stony places and on good ground. The Sower gone out to Sow are those among His 'Called out ones' (_**Ekklesia!)**_ Preaching the true Word to mankind. As Paul said in 1Cor3:6-8

> _I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase. So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor._

<u>Christ is NOT</u> presenting an illustration of His true Church on earth, He is explaining the condition of the World in which exists 'Wheat' & 'Tares' together until the end of the age. His Church (_**Ekklesia**_) is **NOT** invisible they are<u>**CLEARLY**</u>Visible as Lights in a Dark Place, holding forth the Word of life to a crooked and perverse generation! Phil2:15-16\. Christ refers to the Ekklesia as a lighted city set on a hill visible to all.

> _<u>You are the light of the world.</u> A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. Nor do they **light** a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. **Mt5:14-16**_

Nothing in Scripture even remotely suggests that His Church is something invisible to the naked eye, known only to God. In fact it's the<u>**VERY Opposite**</u>! Everything points to a people actively involved in Preaching the Word and Contending for the Truth to keep it pure. They oppose everything false and pull down the Strongholds of fallacy keeping people bared from the Kingdom. <u>In Scripture a Tree is</u> <u>**KNOWN**</u> <u>by the Fruit it produces.</u> It is said that a Good tree cannot produce Bad Fruit and a Bad tree cannot produce Good fruit. (Matt12:33-37) This also is shown to separate the sheep from the goats in that everyone will give account in the Day of Judgment for the content of their heart and the words that came forth from it.

False teachers are known by their Fruit, Mt7:15-20, shown as the bad trees baring only thorns and thistles; Sowing the Word into the thorny hearts of sin Lk8:14, promising people Liberty while they remain Slaves to their corruption. (2Pet3:18) Nothing is hidden to the True Disciples of Christ (Matt10:24-27) it will be brought to Light from the housetops, proclaimed to the World! (Acts17:30-31)

The _**Ekklesia**_ cannot coexist with darkness as <u>a 'little' leaven leavens the whole</u> <u>lump!</u> (Gal5:9) The Called ones are to PURGE out the old leaven (sin) of wickedness from among them in favor of Purity, sincerity and love! (1Tim1:5)

> _Your glorying is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump? Therefore <u>purge out the old leaven,</u> that you may be a new lump, since you truly are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us. Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. **1Cor5:6-8**_

Nothing in Scripture could be more simplistic than the <u>crystalline Truth</u> that Darkness and Light cannot coexist! Paul says in 2Cor6:14 not to be unequally yoked together with such people who are immoral and incredulous toward God. Do not fellowship with them, light and darkness cannot mix. John speaks of this Light:

> _This then is the message which we have heard of him, and declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. <u>If we say that we have fellowship with him,</u> and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: **1Jh1:5-6**_

Within the _**Ekklesia**_ of Christ every effort is to be put forth to expel the notion that people walking in the darkness of sin can have fellowship with God and true communion with the Saints. The entire purpose of the Gospel is to turn people from darkness to light from the power of Satan to God! Acts26:18\. The Saints are 'children of the light' 1Thes5:5, and cannot dwell in a System devoted to idolatry and sin.

Certainly false teachers will attempt to come in and corrupt the true Saints and even rise up from among the assembly. (Acts20:29-30) While others will come in by **'stealth'** (Gal2:4) and try to bring them into bondage to their doctrines and traditions. Even Paul lamented the perils of '<u>**false brethren'**</u> <u>2Cor11:26</u> who had crept in to discourage the Saints to stumble them from the faith. BUT none of this implies that the true Ekklesia is to set by silently and endure vile activity in their midst, lest they fall prey to the error of the wicked. (2Pet3:17) Sin MUST be Exposed and rebuked sharply so others will fear falling into temptation that will Disqualify them from the Kingdom. (Titus1:13)

The early Saints followed the Apostles directive in 'handing' them over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh that their spirit may yet have a chance to be saved in repentance! (1Cor5:5, 1Tim1:19-20) Meaning as it falls in line with our understanding of the Word, they be expelled from fellowship for their refusal to repent and seek reconciliation so they would not cause others to suffer the same shipwreck. Whereas tolerance in these serious matters of sinfulness breeds further complacency among true brethren.

The Establishment Churches will **NOT** clarify sins of disqualification (1Cor6:9-10) among the congregations because of this false <u>'invisible church'</u> concept that compels them to remain silent lest in their attempt to gather up the Tares they inadvertently 'uproot' the Wheat with them.<u>**This is nonsensical for two reasons:**</u>

**First** because the Establishment Churches are the TARE Barns from the beginning. **Second** because there is **NO** Wheat among them to begin with.

Remember the **FIELD** is the World, **NOT** the _**Ekklesia**_ of called out ones. The true Saints exist within the realm of humanity among the immoral and unclean 1Cor5:10, (wheat & tares) BUT they are instructed as an <u>Assembly</u> (_**ekklesia**_) NOT to keep company with people (who may be named a brother!) who are involved in acts of immorality as enumerated in the Scriptures. (1Cor6:9-10, Gal5:19-21)

> _I wrote to you in my epistle <u>not to keep company with sexually immoral people.</u> Yet I certainly did not mean with the sexually immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world. But now I have written to you not to keep company with anyone named a brother, who is sexually immoral, or covetous, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner not even to eat with such a person._

_**1Cor5:9-13**_

<u>Do ANY of the establishment churches practice this?</u> They wouldn't dare expose these types of people and put them out of the church lest they vacate the <u>ENTIRE</u> flock! If they were to Purge out the old leaven 1Cor5:7 and Purify the assembly everyone present would have to Repent as directed in 2Cor7:10-11. <u>This is the very</u> <u>reason that a person</u> brought to true repentance and Purity of heart cannot continue to abide among the Roman's Wretch, sin everyday crowd in the establishment churches. They would rather withdraw themselves entirely from such **hypocrisy** and dwell alone then sit among people who are **obstinate** toward God and refuse to Obey His Word. There can be no true harmony of the Spirit where sin abounds and everyone walks according to the imaginations of their own hearts, thinking no evil will befall them because **NO ONE** is calling sin sin! (Jer23:17)

Nothing disrupts the peace and harmony among true Saints gathering to Study God's Word than contentions or someone living in obvious compromise. The Spirit of Unity is broken by unresolved issues and <u>un-Christ like</u> behavior, especially if the person offending refuses to acknowledge their fault and correct it. When the Spirit is grieved the entire body (gathering) is in distress. Purity, Sincerity and Love is the common thread among true Saints of God. Duplicity can be the ruination of any assembly. _**(ekklesia)**_

The gathering of genuine Christians (His _**ekklesia**_) tests the spirits to see whether or not they come from God. (1Jh4:1) They Search the Scriptures daily (Acts17:11) for verification of Truth. In early writings recorded in the **Didache** the Saints were instructed to discard anyone who came to them with contrary Doctrine that was not in accord with the Lord's wholesome words and doctrine which is in accord to godliness. (1Tim6:3, 2Jn7-10) No teacher or traveling evangelists was permitted to linger from home to home mooching off the charity of the Saints. (Lk10:7, 1Tim5:13) And if his teaching and behavior was not in line with the Scriptures he was considered false.

The great difficulty for those under the establishment System is they wholly believe that the 'Church' (as it exists in its fallen state) is still sanctioned by God. (and they are among the true invisible members of the elect) But until a person can Wake up to recognize that the <u>entire SYSTEM</u> is an <u>illegitimate reproduction</u> of reality they will continue to Worship the False Image of Christ conquered by the dragon, Rev13:11-14 and believe that they can enter His Kingdom in their filthy rag, desperately wicked, wretched condition instead of being cast into the furnace among the<u>**tares**</u> when the false system faces its final Judgment as Mystery Babylon the Great the Mother of Harlots and of the abominations of the earth! Rev17:5, 18:1-8.

The distortion of an '<u>**invisible**</u>' church within the Church (established system, buildings designated as places of worship) owes much of its appeal to the English translation of the Greek word_<u>**ekklesia**</u>_, into <u>Church,</u> which over time has become cemented into the minds of people as the original language of Scripture. It is as though the Apostles instead of going from house to house to assemble the Saints erected a network of cathedrals to collect the wheat and tares for the Day of Judgment. Thus the idea of '<u>**Church**</u>' as it has existed in history is a perfect reflection of the Woman on the Scarlet Beast in Revelation 17:3-5.


## 10. Calling Evil Good and Good Evil

> _Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter! **Isa5:20**_

The Bible paints a Sharp Contrast between the Righteous and the Wicked: _A Righteous man declares his honesty openly, But the witness of the unrighteous is deceitful_ Prov12:10\. However this Distinction has been transformed into a hundred shades of gray in the present day Professing Christian Churches. They take great pleasure <u>impugning the Righteous</u> and casting dispersions on the Pure of heart. But this is nothing new among those 'Wise' in their own eyes. For foolish and inconsiderate men, who have neither wisdom nor instruction, mock and deride the righteous, being eager to exalt themselves in their own conceits!

<u>**David said:**</u> '_They who repaid me evil for good, Slandered me because I pursue Righteousness. And they threw away my love as though it was a stinking corpse!'_ Ps37:21\. Those who hold forth the Word of life, shining the Light of Reconciliation with God through Repentance and Faith Proven by Deeds, are often despised by the <u>Self-</u> <u>professed Christians</u> who delight in their filthy rags, desperately wicked, wretched salvation in sin refuge. In their minds **NONE** are Righteous (Rom3:10) nor is there a person on earth who does not sin! (Ecc7:20) In their realm the very idea of a Righteous person doing the Right thing by faith working by love with a heart made Pure by Obedience to the faith is unattainable. They see all 'Christians' defiled to the core, but 'Saved' by Grace and 'Covered' by imputed righteousness.

The deceitfulness of sin, springing up within their hearts has defiled their understanding (Heb12:15) As <u>the Bible says:</u> **'**_**A person without discernment {between good & evil} persuades himself to mingle with the unruly.'**_ Prov14:16\. That's why among the incredulous Professed Christians **NOTHING** is Pure! They see everyone as a mirror image of themselves and anyone who denies it is a Liar.

> _To the pure all things are pure, but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience are defiled. They profess to know God, but in works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work. **Titus1:15-16**_

The Righteous have always been Slandered and disdained by the professing religious establishment who persist in sin. Paul said to them; '_<u>**Am I become your**</u>__<u>**enemy by telling you the truth**</u>_<u>?'</u> This is often the response from those who use such passages as Rom3:10, Ecc7:20 as an **excuse** NOT to pursue Purity of heart or Cleansing from inward sin. 'Who can have a Pure heart or say they are clean from sin' they will proclaim, as quoting the rhetorical question in Proverbs 20:9, as though Scripture deems human Purity impossible. Yet the Lord Cries loudly; 'BLESSED <u>are</u> <u>the</u> <u>**PURE**</u> <u>in heart for they shall SEE God!'</u> Mt5:8 And 'Without holiness (purity) **NO ONE** will see the Lord! Heb12:14

<u>**In the Bible the theme is;**</u> '_He who Judges the unrighteous as righteous and the righteous as unrighteous is unclean and an abomination to God'_ Prov17:16\. BUT isn't this Exactly what the Fallacy of Transferred (or imputed) Righteousness does to the people who 'receive' it as truth? They remain desperately wicked in heart by their own admission and offer God only filthy rags of sin. They live contrary to God's Commands and call good evil and evil good. <u>The</u> <u>**FEAR**</u> <u>of the Lord is to</u> <u>**HATE**</u> <u>Sin!</u> Ps97:10, **NOT** glory in it as though shameful behavior keeps you humble.

"_**Evil people hate the Wisdom and instruction of God and CHOOSE Not to fear the Lord**_" Prov1:31\. In this Professing Christians are exonerated from wrong doing by the fallacy of 'inbred' sin. **BUT** the Bible says that man sins by the <u>wrong use of his</u> <u>free will,</u> **NOT** by a corrupt nature within. A person will do evil things with contempt if he 'believes' within himself he lacks the ability to resist the deceptions of sin. Prov13:11\. This also will cause him to devise evil things and cast them as dispersions on the Righteous. Prov14:22\. Thus again to the defiled (in heart) and incredulous by choice **NOTHING** is Pure!

Scripture assures those who follow the Lord in Purity, Sincerity and Love; '_**All who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution**_' 2Tim3:12\. From the beginning this has been so, the Professed have always sought Justification in their sins. **WHY** did Cain slay his brother? Because Abel's Deeds were Righteous and his evil! (1Jh3:12-13, So do not marvel brethren if the world hates you!) <u>The Lord tells us:</u>

> _Blessed are you when men hate you, And when they exclude you, And revile you, and cast out your name as evil, For the Son of Man's sake. Rejoice in that day and leap for joy! For indeed your reward is great in heaven, For in like manner their fathers did to the prophets. **Lk6:22-23**_

Yet in Professing Christian gatherings where everyone is a 'sinner <u>saved by grace',</u> admittedly wretched to the core, the exact opposite is true. The World **LOVES** them and they Love the World! But to their audaciousness the Lord says: _**Woe to you when all men speak well of you, For so did their fathers to the false prophets. Lk6:26**_ But they Judge Righteousness (doing what is right) as Un-Righteousness, in their minds---- <u>SELF-Righteousness!</u> If a person with a Purified heart is '**made sad'** because sin is abounding and excused by the Doctrines of men, they will devise more evil against him and conjure further false Judgments to impugn his character and strengthen the hand of the wicked. Ezk13:22

> _Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and you have strengthened the hands of the wicked, so that he does not turn from his wicked way to save his life._

<u>It's a</u> <u>**LIE**</u> to Promise the sinner Peace, healing and prosperity while he stubbornly refused to Cease from evil and Learn to do good! **Isa1:16**. The Pulpit Pundits keep crying Peace, Peace when there is no Peace in their attempts to slight the sins of the people with words that do not profit. (Jer6:14, 7:8-10) Sins of fornication, adultery, drunkenness, uncleanness and lust abound among them and <u>STILL they Come</u> as 'the Lord's own' and sit before their altars and listen to the lovely songs and pleasurable soothing words believing that nothing evil will come upon them although they refuse to **DO** what the Lord has Commanded. (Ezk33:31-32, Jer23:17)

> _They continually say to those who despise Me, The LORD has said, "You shall have peace"And to everyone who walks according to the dictates of his own heart, they say, 'No evil shall come upon you'._

<u>The Bible Says that</u> Nothing unrighteous can ever be Pleasing to the Righteous Prov14:23\. This is why they cannot abide in darkness or condone immoral behavior. <u>SIN is a Reproach</u> to any people, Prov14:14, and those who excuse it have denied the Truth!<u>**Quote**</u>: 'To fall is not as grievous as to lie where we have fallen, nor to be wounded so dreadful as after wounds to **REFUSE** healing' The Lord asks you to use your human Senses of Sight, Hearing and <u>Understanding</u> to turn be converted to Him that He may **HEAL** you! Matt13:14-15\. In that Man<u>**LEARNS**</u> to Do Good and seeks after the Light of Understanding through the Spirit of Wisdom, understanding, counsel, might, knowledge, godliness and fear of God. (Isa11:2-3)

By accepting His gracious invitation to forsake your vises and sinful passions and desires in repentance (from which you lack spiritual discernment to know the truth) you will find this Healing with the <u>Crown of Righteousness</u> and keep a **Straight Path** of understanding and knowledge. (Prov9:5-6, 2Tim4:8, Gal5:24, Rom6:4-6)

Suffering for Righteousness sake is part of Counting the Cost of Discipleship. (Lk14f:28) To the True Saints of God it is considered a Badge of honor to suffer persecution for doing good and it is often at the hands of a Religious Establishment bent on our destruction because we expose their sins. The Bible speaks much of sharing in the suffering of Christ, who was also despised by the entrenched establishment and crucified.

> _For to you it has been granted on behalf of Christ, not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for His sake, **Phil1:29**_

> _And who is he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good? But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. "And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled." But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear; having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed. For it is better, if it is the will of God, to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. **1Pet3:13-17**_

> _But what things were gain to me, these I have counted loss for Christ. Yet indeed I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith; that I may know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if, by any means, I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. **Phil3:7-11**_

We Follow in the Steps of the Savior when the Professing Religious establishment World hates us!

> _<u>If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you. If you were of the</u> <u>world, the world would love its own.</u> Yet because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted Me, they will also persecute you. If they kept My word, they will keep yours also. But all these things they will do to you for My name's sake, because they do not know Him who sent Me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would have no sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin. He who hates Me hates My Father also. If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would have no sin; but now they have seen and also hated both Me and My Father. But this happened that the word might be fulfilled which is written in their law, 'They hated Me without a cause. **Jn15:18-25**_

Understand that they called the Master Beelzebub so how MUCH more will they call His Servants the same, Matt10:25\. Further evidence that the present 'saved <u>in sin'</u> establishment is bogus can be seen in what Jesus told His Disciples would happen to them by Preaching the Gospel. (and it certainly has absolutely NO resemblance to the festive religious environment the professed attend to)

<u>Be assured anyone who Preaches the Full Council of God will:</u>

- Be hated by the world for His Name's sake

- Persecuted and despised, rejected, ostracized, especially by the Religious establishment

- Family members will reject you

- They will call you the devil

<u>**Proverbs 14:12, 16:25**</u> says there is a **way** that seems right to man but its end is the way of death. Such is the Wide Road professing Christians take who impugn the character of the Righteous. The Bible says that only 'sinners' pursue the righteous in such manner as to find fault in them. (Ps36:32) <u>The works of the Righteous produce</u> <u>**LIFE**</u> (freedom from sin, purity of heart) only the ungodly produce iniquity, Ps10:17\. When you tell people they are saved by Grace yet remain desperately wicked in heart, wretched to the core (sold under sin!) and can never be any better than a pile of filthy rags, you<u>**DENY**</u> the WORD of God!

<u>For if 'Christians' are nothing more than a people addicted to various lust of the</u> <u>flesh</u> the Bible condemns as sin of disqualification, then true Righteousness is a fairy tale and the devil wins! Honestly isn't sin a **reproach** on any people as the Bible says? How can anyone of right conscience continue to sit under a Gospel that has produced such sordid results as we see in the present day churches? People are crying out in the misery that sin has wrought in their lives and the Church can only offer them a <u>Magic Cloak</u> and vain prayer that God will clean them up if they faithfully attend their focus groups and read the latest books. <u>NO Redemption, NO</u> <u>Release from Bondage, NO Purging the conscience</u> from the dead works of the flesh; Just a Vain assurance that God has made Provision and understands your struggles.

Paul said such vile things as lust, uncleanness and filthiness of the flesh should<u>**NOT**</u><u>**EVEN**</u> be Named among those who Profess Christ! (Eph5:5-6) **YET** the addiction to internet Pornography is so rampant among Pastors and professing Christian men that organizations such as Promise Keepers can fill football Stadiums with attendees wallowing in it! NEVER are they told to<u>**REPENT**</u><u>, Come Clean,</u> <u>**TURN**</u> from such things before it destroys their souls in Perdition; Books, CD's and Hype are NOT going to Save them! <u>It's a hopeless addiction and vicious circle of repeated failure</u> <u>with the only remedy True Repentance.</u> On top of this you have Professed Christians involved in every Kind of vile and unclean behavior, loving the world, dead toward God, making excuses all day long about inability, sin nature, magic covers, not of works, and the Pastors in full agreement. No Wonder they **Call good evil and evil good** for they **DO** things all day long that are<u>**HATFUL to God**</u> and take Pleasure in themselves and others doing even worse!

**Genuine Spiritual Discernment is FAR From the Foolish!** Prov15:21 _Folly is joy to him who is destitute of discernment, But a man of understanding walks uprightly_.


## 11. Faithfulness to keeping the Commands of God

> _'The Just man shall Live by his Faithfulness to God's Commands!' **Hakk2:4 (Septuagint)**_

**WHY** are <u>Most Professing Christians</u> today so adamantly in favor of sin? **WHY** are they so Blinded to the Simple Words of Scripture demanding a **Departure** from iniquity if you are to inherit the Kingdom of God? What has brought them to such a level of Delusion that they all Parrot the same absurd notions defending their right to sin. **HOW** have the Pastors and Bible Pundits been able to so thoroughly convince them that accountability has been canceled out because they <u>'received'</u> Jesus as their Savior?

The layers of Deception are infinite in number all based on **ZERO** Logic in the face of Bible Truth.

Christ says '_<u>**Go and Sin no more**</u>_<u>!'</u> They say its 'impossible' for anyone to Stop sinning. Scripture says a person is <u>Justified by what he</u> <u>**DOES**</u> <u>and Not by Faith alone.</u> They say you are Justified in your sins. Christ said if you **Love Me** you will Obey & Keep My Commandments. They say the Royal law has been abolished and that Christ obeyed for you. In the Bible **FAITH** Works by Love, Purifies the heart of sin and has Victory over sin, the flesh and the devil. They say <u>'it's NOT of Works'</u> and no one can be Pure.

<u>Thus like a Ventriloquist dummy they mimic the nonsensical:</u>

- We're Born in Sin, Saved in Sin and no one can ever Stop sinning!

- All sin is the same, it's impossible to not sin, everyone sins daily in thought, word & deed

- If we could Stop sinning we wouldn't need Jesus & could save ourselves

- Anyone who claims to have Stopped sinning is a liar with no truth in them

The Bible No Where Says that Christ Obeyed for you or Transferred His Righteousness to you by faith.

Nothing in Scripture suggests that Sin is forgiven in advance by virtue of Christ's sacrifice on the cross.

Grace **Does NOT** imply that you can sin with impunity & not be held accountable for wrong doing.

Let's take up the issue of Faith as it is Imputed to a believing person as Righteousness. The Bible repeatedly says that '<u>**FAITH'**</u> <u>is imputed as righteousness.</u> (Rom3:22, 4:3,9, 11, 13, 22, 10:6, Gal3:6, 5:5, Phil3:9) **BUT** No Where is it said that **CHRIST** is Imputed as Righteousness or that a believing person is **CLOTHED** in His Righteousness. These statements are theological Conjecture,<u>**Plain LIES**</u> repeated with the intent of persuading a person there is no such thing as Personal Righteousness.

<u>**What is Righteousness?**</u> Basically it's **DOING** What is Right! Defined as: Integrity, Virtue, Purity, right behavior, right mindedness.

Very Simple: '_**He who DOES what is Right is Righteous'**_ 1John3:7

<u>**In the New Testament man is told to**</u>:

- _Seek first his Righteousness! **Matt6:33**_

- _Have exceeding Righteousness! **Matt5:20**_

- _Serve Him in Righteousness! **Lk1:75**_

- _Work Righteousness **Acts10:35**_

- _Present your body as an Instrument of Righteousness **Rom6:17**_

- _Be a SLAVE to Righteousness **Rom6:18**_

- _Have Righteousness unto holiness **Rom6:19**_

- _Awake to Righteousness and sin not! **1Cor15:34**_

- _Put on the New Man in Righteousness & True holiness **Eph4:24**_

- _Breastplate of Righteousness **Eph6:14**_

- _Fruits of Righteousness **Phil1:11**_

- _Follow after Righteousness, **1Tim6:11, 2Tim2:22**_

- _Noah, a Preacher of Righteousness! **2Pet2:5**_

- _DOING Righteousness! **1Jh3:7**_

<u>Therefore since Faith is Connected to Righteousness</u> in Scripture there **MUST** be a Working Dynamic between the two. Paul said in Rom1:17 _For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, The just shall live by faith._ **HOW** is this Righteousness revealed?<u>**BY FAITH to FAITH**</u>, But In What Manner? Again Scripture provides the answers:

- _Faith that is Working by Love **Gal5:6**_

- _Upholding and Establishing the Law, **Rom3:31**_

- _Having Victory over the World, Flesh and Devil! **1John5:4-5**_

<u>**Thus FAITH is FAITHFULNESS**</u> to Keeping the Commands of God! _The Just man shall Live by his Faithfulness to God's Commands!' Hakk2:4_ (Properly translated from the Hebrew text) So when Paul repeated this truth in Rom1:17, Gal3:11, Heb10:38, in his Mind <u>belief or</u> <u>**FAITH**</u> in God fit flawlessly into the Greatest Commandment of all; '_You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind' Mt22:37._ It was **NEVER** a theory that a mere confession in God was the 'faith' required to save a man's soul.

The <u>alleged contradictions</u> the Reformers professed to have found between faith and works in the Old and New Testament, exists only in the imaginations of their minds. Belief in God is fully is expressed in a passionate devotion to doing God's will and deep sense of union with Christ, which means self denial, obedience and a zeal to follow Him. So when the Prophet cries out (in the mouth of Peter on the Day of Pentecost Acts2:21) _'Whoever calls upon the Name of the Lord shall be Saved!'_ No one present supposed it meant anything less than a full commitment to Christ to <u>'</u>_<u>**Go and**</u>_ _<u>**Sin no more!**</u>_' Jh5:14, 8:11\. Anyone who presumes it means doing nothing but expressing a belief in God is foolishly denying the Truth.

<u>Justification by faith was</u> <u>**NOT**</u> a new subject to the Jews in the time of Christ. It was often debated among the Rabbis, reconciling the deeds of the faithful with the faith that Justifies. They understood that the Scripture declared Abraham Righteous by faith, Gen15:6\. And that David confirmed '_Blessed is the man whose lawless deeds are forgiven and whose sins are covered' Ps32:1._<u>**BUT**</u> unlike the <u>disingenuous 'Reformers'</u> they compared Scripture with Scripture, Precept upon Precept. (1Cor2:13-15, Isa28:9- 10) They were able to grasp the full intent of faith and deeds <u>Working together</u> to Produce a Righteousness God could impute (or reckon) as a real virtue in man. (not something foreign or imagined)

> _Do you see that faith was working together with his works, and by works faith was made perfect? And the Scripture was fulfilled which says, Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. And he was called the friend of God. You see then that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only. **Jas2:22-24**_

So this dispels the 'faith <u>alone'</u> (_sola fida_) myth and the <u>Reformed presupposition</u> that a person can be Justified and declared Righteous while still in their sins. Plus it's directly in line with Abraham's steadfast Obedience, Heb11:8, Rom4:22, and David's restoration after a bitter Repentance (Read entire Ps32 & 51) in which he had <u>**Stopped sinning**</u> and sought to be reconciled back to God. Faith that Saves or 'Perfected <u>faith'</u> produces love and devotion exhibited in a life transformed in Christ and fully conformed to the Teachings of the Master revealed in the Gospels. Thus we find Abraham unwavering, strengthened and fully persuaded in the Promises of God and **THAT'S** the Reason his **FAITH** was accounted to him for<u>**Righteousness!**</u>(Rom4:19-22)

Attributing this imputation of Righteousness by faith to a person who has not made the **Slightest** effort whatsoever to Love and Obey Christ is the Greatest injustice that can possibly be done to the souls of men! The Reformers are guilty of a blatant disregard for accuracy and a disturbing misuse of the Scriptures, that the Apostle would call '<u>**Twisting**</u>' 2Pet3:16\. (literal metaphor; to torture as on the rack!) This kind of distortion has **NOT** occurred by accident. Proverbs 14:22 says that when a man lacks in discernment (of Wisdom & uprightness) he will **DEVISE** evil things. **NOTHING** could be more <u>diabolical</u> than telling a person they are <u>Justified and</u> <u>Declared Righteous while STILL in their SINS!</u>

This is much more than merely Reformed error, it's Intentionally shutting up the Kingdom against men Jesus taught Belief and Righteousness in the Sermon on the Mount, Parables, the Prodigal Son and stories of Repentant sinners. His life and His death were lived on Behalf of mankind leaving us an<u>**EXAMPLE**</u> to<u>**FOLLOW**</u> <u>in His</u> <u>Steps.</u> (1Pet2:21) Everything about His Doctrine is associated with<u>**DOING,**</u><u>**OBEYING, ENDURING!**</u> The Apostles reflected this in every aspect of their lives. Their teaching was in **TOTAL** Harmony with the Master and Never diminished the necessary of the **DEEDS** of Righteousness, proving the presence of a Faith working by Love, Purifying the heart of sin.

But the Preachers and Bible Pundits tell people the<u>**VERY OPPOSITE!**</u> They insist that Doing anything is trying to Establish your own Righteousness and Save yourself. They tell people that no one can ever Stop sinning because they are inwardly depraved, lacking ability to Obey and wholly disposed to evil.<u>**Via:**</u>The Roman's Wretch, Chief of sinners, Desperately wicked heart, filthy rags, **LIES**.

Thus the Parrots line up and chant the lyrics of their own **Doom**, all the time believing it's approved by God and another Generation <u>sinks into the Depths of</u> <u>Perdition</u> in lock-step with the hordes of hell.

Everything Good is Bad, Everything Wrong is Right, Everything True is False.

<u>It's an entire System of LIES;</u> Religious, Secular, Media, amusements, etc All designed to create a mass of Mind numbed, sycophants, marching down the Wide Road to destruction as unconscious lemmings who <u>LOVE & Practice the LIE!</u>

> _But outside are dogs and sorcerers and sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and whoever loves and practices a lie. **Rev22:15**_


## 12. You Reap What you Sow (the inevitable consequences of sin)

> _Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for whatever a man sows, that he will also reap. For he who sows to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit will of the Spirit reap everlasting life. **Gal6:7-8**_

The Bible assures us that the thief comes to <u>Steal, Kill and Destroy;</u> But Christ has come to bring abundant Life! (John10:10) Redemption in Christ is the Promise of a life<u>**FREE**</u> <u>from the 'Corruption'</u> that is in the world through lust. (2Pet1:3-4) Reaping Corruption is sowing unto Death, meaning in the Scripture the **OPPOSITE** of Spiritual, abundant Life! '_For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you Put to death the deeds of the body you will live!'_ _**Rom8:13**_

Corruption of the body is a natural occurrence. (from the dust you came to the dust you shall return Gen3:19) But Corruption of the spirit is a moral decadence that will result in Eternal misery separated from God. Death in the Bible is '_**Thanatos'**_, It is used in reference to Physical death of the body (1Cor15:54-56) and spiritual Death of the soul (as second death Rev20:6, 13-14) Therefore when the Scripture says that Sowing according to the flesh Reaps Corruption or Death (Rom8, Gal6) it applies to the spirit of man reaping eternal misery in hell.

Why would Peter say in 2Pet1:4 that the Promises were given so that man could <u>**ESCAPE**</u> the Corruption that is in the world through Lust, if it meant anything **LESS** than the Same Corruption people walking according to the lust and uncleanness of their flesh would also suffer? (2Pet2:10, 12) The same holds true of Rom8:6 _'To be Carnally minded is Death, to be spiritually minded is life and Peace'_. <u>Carnal is</u> <u>**FLESH,**</u> _**Sarx**_, Sowing to the **Flesh** reaps Corruption and Death, in the Same sense as Gal6, eternal misery in hell. It doesn't require a degree in Rocket Science to Understand this!

The early Christians (untainted by the doctrines & opinions of men) said there '_**There are two ways, one of life, one of death and there is a GREAT Difference between the two Ways'**_ (Didache 1:1) In their Minds the Gospel of Christ was a **CHOICE** man had to make between the<u>**WIDE**</u> <u>Road</u> leading to Destruction or the<u>**NARROW**</u> <u>Way</u> leading to life eternal. (Matt7:14) If '<u>**Christians**</u>' could Sow Continually to the lust of their flesh, reaping only destruction and misery in their lives on earth, and<u>**STILL**</u><u>inherit</u> eternal life, there is really no Point in the Bible to Differentiate between Ways. Therefore if **BOTH** Ways lead to eternal life **WHY** put forth any Effort to Escape the Corruption to begin with?

Herein is the Great Delusion of Present Day Professing Christianity.

They Wallow in Corruption, Shame, Degradation and Destruction, **CRYING** out for help because sin has made ruination of their lives, **BUT YET REMAIN** in the Pig Pen descending deeper and deeper into the depths of their own depravity. The Words of their Pastor-Shepherds have made them<u>**Worthless**</u> as they seek godly council and find only further <u>Vain Promises</u> of Peace that cannot profit. They gather before the Lord without **Shame** and claim His Promise of eternal life while they Walk according to the evil desires (and imaginations) of their flesh. But<u>**SIN**</u> <u>is</u> <u>**NOT**</u> without its Consequences if the remnants of a conscience still reside within their heart.

<u>As certain as you will Reap what you Sow,</u> so also<u>**SIN**</u> <u>will Separate you from God.</u> _'Your iniquities have separated you from your God and your sins have hidden His face from you!' Isa59:2\. 'He who covers his sins shall not prosper, but confesses and__<u>**FORSAKES**</u>_ _them shall have mercy!' Prov28:13._ The Eternal Truth remains despite what the worthless Shepherds are saying .<u>**MERCY**</u> is extended **ONLY** to those who<u>**FORSAKE**</u>(depart from, leave behind, abandon, get free from) their **SINS!** But if you believe within your mind that you can never <u>STOP Sinning</u> then the outcome of Judgment is certain, and anguish and distress will be your constant companions in life.

<u>Reaping a Harvest of Sin!</u>

<u>Here's a Short List of the Common Sins Professing Christians are admittedly in bondage to:</u>

1) Internet Pornography, rampant among Pastors, church leaders & men in general

2) Marriage infidelity including all sorts of unclean relationships, same sex & multiple partners

3) Fornications with multiple partners involving children born to unwed mothers, beatings, moral abuse

4) Drunkenness, worldly indulgences, excessive debauchery and abominable behavior

Professing Christians like to put on airs to maintain a 'form' <u>of godliness.</u> Although the churches are hot beds for immoral behavior of every sort, not everyone has soiled themselves to the same level of corruption as described above. **BUT** by their silence in the midst of such ungodliness they are approving of those who  <u>**DO practice**</u> these things! (Rom1:31) No one could say it better than <u>Prophet Jeremiah:</u>

> _**"They have sown wheat but reaped thorns; They have put themselves to pain but do not profit. But be ashamed of you Harvest because the Lord's anger is against you!' Jer12:13**_

In accordance this perfectly describes the perspective of present Day Christianity. They **SOW** the Word of God into the _**thorny hearts**_ of a stiff necked people bent on plowing in a field of iniquity; thus eating the fruit of lies and trusting in their own way. (Hosea10:13) They claim 'this is God's merciful Love!' **BUT** again they error because _**'Those who LOVE GOD HATE Sin!'**_ Ps97:10 and they possess a burning urgency in their hearts to pull such people<u>**OUT**</u> of the fire before it's too late! <u>They</u> <u>**NEVER**</u> passively assume that people doing such things are on Safe ground with God. (because you reap what you sow!)

_<u>**Lies make the heart of the Righteous sad**</u>_ Ezk13:22 and when they hear a Pastor promising sinners liberty in Christ while they remain slaves to their corruption 2Pet2:18, they Grieve with God! They can **NEVER** stand by while the Church patronizes people living in vile sins of the flesh with a smile and handshake in the pretense of a phony love they **THINK** pleases God. **BUT** they know<u>**NOTHING**</u>about the True Nature of God! _**LOVE DOES NOT Rejoice in iniquity, but rejoices in the Truth! 1Cor13:6.**_ If you loved them as God loves you would **TELL** them the **TRUTH** about sin!

> _**'By Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged and by the fear of the Lord men DEPART evil!' Prov16:6**_

But it's a _**'Judge not'**_ world among the professed today. No one (including the Pastors) sheds a tear for the lost souls sowing corruption and death. Collectively they have **ALL** bought into the same lies that everyone's a wretched sinner saved by Grace and has no place telling others what they should or should not do. They all Sup at the same table in darkness and delusion and its God's responsibility to 'Clean' up the sin in His own good time.<u>**BUT HOW**</u> can anyone **TURN** from sin they believe is <u>PRE-FORGIVEN</u> when they (supposedly) accepted Christ? There is <u>no incentive to motivate</u> a true godly sorrow that would lead to a genuine repentance and clearing of the wrong doing. It's too easy and much more conducive to excuse the sin as some inbred malady and continue believing God is lenient. (After all the sun continues to rise, the rain fall, blessings flow and Judgment lingers)

> _Because the sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil. Though a sinner does evil a hundred times, and his days are prolonged, yet I surely know that it will be well with those who fear God, who fear before Him. But it will not be well with the wicked; nor will he prolong his days, which are as a shadow, because he does not fear before God. **Ecc8:11-13**_

<u>But His longsuffering, goodness and Patience</u> (waiting for you to come to you senses and _**Repent**_ Rom2:4) is wasted on those in the Delusion of pre-forgiven sins. They were Born in sin, Justified in sin and glory in it without shame or fear of Judgment. They can Sow a **HARVEST** of iniquity and tell others all day long how much they <u>**LOVE**</u> <u>God</u> and rejoice in His presence, while they drag His **Holy Name** into the gutters of lust, perversion, drunkenness, broken homes and filth! **HOW** long before the <u>Ax is laid to the Root</u> and the Lord's winnowing fan purges out the chaff? Matt3:12

<u>Man's</u> <u>**Concept**</u> <u>of God</u> determines his understanding of <u>Right and Wrong,</u> Darkness and Light and the Righteous and the Wicked. Without proper discernment into these matters man will device a distorted perception of Righteous Judgment. They will <u>**NOT**</u> be able to distinguish between those who serve God and those who do not serve Him. (Malachi 3:10) This skewed Image of God is the reason why so many Professing Christians believe the can <u>Sow to their fleshly</u> (carnal) Corruptions and still Reap **LIFE!**

What the Religious Establishment has done in the Name of Christianity is Create an **IMAGE** of God that has the appearance of Righteousness but reflects the nature of man. (i.e. _as fully explained in Romans chapter 1:18-31\. They know Him as the God of Creation, including His attributes of holiness, mercy and love. Even recognize His eternal power and Godhead, but__<u>**FAIL**</u>_ _to properly glorify Him as revealed)._ Thus they create in their minds an **IMAGE** made like <u>'corruptible'</u> Man. Consequently God's revealed sense of fairness is offset in favor of Sin. <u>No longer</u> does He Judge a sinful person by searching their hearts, testing their minds and **GIVING** to everyone According to their **WAYS.** (Jer17:10) {_reap what you sow}_<u>**NOW**</u> <u>He reverses</u> the Process and Rewards the sinful & double-minded with Eternal Life!

In this manner a genuine Righteous Judgment is impossible. (Jh7:24) The ill-defined image of God's Mercy in the mind of man has rendered the distinction between the Righteous and Wicked indistinguishable. Thoughtlessly professing Christians will call evil good and good evil wholly unaware they are<u>**mocking God**</u>! (Isa5:20, Gal6:7) They refuse His healing and arrogantly proclaim 'who can boast having a Pure heart or declare boldly they are clean from sin!' As though God hand is shortened that it cannot **FREE** them from the corrupting influence of Sin. (Isa59:1-2, 2Pet1:3-4)

Because the Professing Christian System has a wrong concept of God they deny the possibility of having a <u>Pure heart</u> and use that as an<u>**EXCUSE NOT**</u> to Pursue one. And since there is also no possibility of being cleansed (clean inside) of sin they use that as an excuse to sin more. By necessity Pastors and other Bible Pundits will <u>rationalize Righteousness</u> (even _the possibility of doing what is right by faith working by love_) calling it **'Unrighteousness'**, and slandering the truly **'Holy'** person as unclean! (Prov21:14, Ps37:21)

Scripture reveals that the <u>Law of the Lord is Perfect</u> converting the soul. His testimony is Sure, His statutes Right. His Commandment is **Pure** enlightening the eyes and the fear of the Lord is **CLEAN!** Ps19:7-9\. Blessed is the man who<u>**KEEPS**</u>His Word and Seeks Him with the whole heart. He will do no iniquity, Walk in His ways and Diligently searches out the depths of understanding. Ps119:2-6\. The<u>**WORD**</u>is his Rock, his lamp, his constant companion to guide him in his daily walk. He guards his heart with discernment and rejoices to<u>**DO**</u> <u>what is Right!</u> (Prov6:23, Ps62:6, 1Jh3:7)

<u>The Double-minded (carnal) cannot know the real Mercy of God.</u> They can only devise a reflection of themselves from reading His Word with duplicity in their hearts; So that the <u>Righteous Judgments</u> of God are<u>**not fair**</u> to recompense every man according to his ways. (reaping what they have sown, corruption or life: '_**Return now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good!**_ _Jer18:11, Ezk18:29-32)_ **BUT** instead of repenting (and forsaking) the deceptions that excuse their sin they find a false sense of Justification in unrighteousness! (thus 'suppressing' the Truth and exchanging it for a lie Rom1:18, 25) Accordingly the Professing Christian Establishment is<u>**REAPING a HARVEST**</u> <u>of Sin!</u>

> _Sow for yourselves righteousness; Reap in mercy; Break up your fallow ground, For it is time to seek the LORD, Till He comes and rains righteousness on you. You have plowed wickedness; You have reaped iniquity. You have eaten the fruit of lies, Because you trusted in your own way, **Hosea10:12-13**_
