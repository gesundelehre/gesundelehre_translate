# No Longer Deceived By Eternal Security

### Mark

After I received Christ in May of 1981 I attended a Baptist Church that taught the once saved always saved (OSAS) doctrine. The first 5 years of what was supposed to be my **[new life in God](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/new-creation.html)** turned out to be just a profession. **I was taught that my salvation was an act only by God and that once I received Christ He was bound to keep me regardless of my lifestyle.** There was just one problem. After just a few short years (5) I noticed that my life exhibited no change and yet people around me told me that I was eternally secure and had God’s favor. In my heart I knew that God could never be approving of my lifestyle being that heaven and God Himself is Holy. In my heart I knew that obedience to His Word and living out His principles in my life brought me closer and closer to God. I wasted years thinking I was living a life pleasing to God when all I was doing was denying and disowning Him through my very lifestyle.

I thank God for opening my eyes to what true obedience and being holy is really about. We can’t expect to come before a holy God and expect Him to welcome us when we lived a lifestyle with sin and disobedience to His Word. I thank God for Evangelical Outreach for their willingness to go out to those who have been taken captive by that hellish doctrine of [once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) and have been liberated to truly worshiping God with ALL our heart, mind, and soul. **Don’t forget that without holiness none will see the Lord and those who are happy are those who hear the Word of God and put it into practice.** God Bless you!
