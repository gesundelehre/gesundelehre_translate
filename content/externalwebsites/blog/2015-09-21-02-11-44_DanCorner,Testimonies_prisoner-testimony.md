# Prisoner Testimony

Dear Sir,

Thank you very much for the “Believer’s Conditional Security.” This whole subject of the **[once saved always saved](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** has made me weary. For me **it had become quite an issue.** Then one day at mail-call, out of the blue I received a book by Daniel Corner. And to this very day I have not a clue who sent me this blessed knowledge? And it couldn’t of come at a better time towards the end of my jail sentence and I have been pennyless this whole sentence. So now here I am humbly requesting “The Myth of Eternal Security” and if at all possible, “The Gospel According to Charles Stanley.” Believe me, if I had the money to send you I would for these books. But I don’t! That’s not to say once I get established out in the free world when released in 7 months and if you can trust my word here? I will send you the value owed plus interest. And please by all means send me a catalog and I will definitely find people of interest to order books from you. You can consider me an asset or a wise investment. **Again, thank you for the wealth of soul saving information you have impacted to me!** God bless you!

Your prayers and **[donations](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/support.html)** help to make this possible too. God bless you.
