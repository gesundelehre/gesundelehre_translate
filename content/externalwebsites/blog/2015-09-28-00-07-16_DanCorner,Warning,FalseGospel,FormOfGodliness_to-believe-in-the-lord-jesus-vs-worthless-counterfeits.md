# To Believe In The Lord Jesus vs WORTHLESS Counterfeits

**Over the centuries certain English words have changed their meanings. _Gay_ is a prime example of this and, in our day, it is now related to [_homosexuality_](http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/homosexual.htm "I Was Headed For Hell as a Homosexual")! When such changes occur with key Biblical terms, especially if they are related to salvation, it becomes of the utmost importance to know what words or phrases changed and how we should understand them now. It could make a _salvation_ difference — a difference between God’s Paradise kingdom (Rev. 2:7 cf. 21:4) and [eternal punishment](http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternaltorment.htm "Eternal Torment") (Mt. 25:46)!**


## _Believe In The Lord Jesus_

**The perfect salvation question was asked by the Philippian jailer — _What must I do to be saved_ (Acts 16:30)? The answer to his question is vital to understand for salvation’s sake, but in our day this has been distorted and neutralized into a mere, easy and powerless, mental assent (consenting to the historical facts about Messiah).** Paul and Silas answered:

> **Believe in the Lord Jesus**, and you will be **saved.** (Acts 16:31)

**What did _believe in the Lord Jesus_ mean back in first century Christianity? That is the question and its answer is vital, not what a secular dictionary says about the meaning of _believe_ today.** By comparing scripture related to salvation with that scripture (Acts 16:31), we will find the original answer and vital truth.


## _Believe In The Lord Jesus_ = Acts 20:21

Just as 2+2 = 5-1, to _believe in the Lord Jesus_ also = Acts 20:21\. In Acts 20:21, Paul answered:

> I have declared to both Jews and Greeks that they must **turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus.**

**So sometime after Acts 16:31, Paul equated his answer to the Philippian jailer to his statement in Acts 20:21 — _turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus._** That was Paul’s answer to our present day enigma. Problem solved. We now know what Paul meant by _believe in the Lord Jesus_. To _believe in the Lord Jesus_, therefore, includes:

-  [**repentance**](http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.htm "Biblical Repentance") (turning from evil ways)
-  faith (trust) in the Lord Jesus

_Repentance,_ therefore, is a necessity for initial salvation (getting born again). By comparing scripture with scripture, _repentance_ is shown to be _turn from evil ways_ (Mt. 12:41 cf. Jonah 3:10), though there is not a hint of _repentance_ by just reading Acts 16:31\. **_Repentance_, therefore, is included in the meaning of [_believe on Jesus_](http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/believing.htm "Is Believing On Jesus The Same As Obeying Him"). **It was originally understood that way! That is how the jailer took it and how Paul and Silas meant it to be understood.**

Furthermore, the [**focus is on the Lord Jesus**](http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/Jesusfocus.htm "Jesus Focus"). He is the Savior. He is our hope. It was his blood that was shed for us. Our faith must be in JESUS and not another, including [**Mary**](http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mary.htm "Fabricated Mary of Catholicism") too. That focus on Jesus too is included in believe in the Lord Jesus. It is now much more clear as to the original meaning of Acts 16:31, but it even becomes more clear with 1 Thess. 1:9!


## 1 Thess 1:9 = _Believe in the Lord Jesus_

Referring back to the conversion of the Thessalonians, Paul wrote:

> For they themselves report what kind of reception you gave us. They tell how you **turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God** (1 Thess. 1:9)

Compare the above scriptures, we now know that _believe in the Lord Jesus_ (Acts 16:31) = _turn to God in repentance and have faith in our Lord Jesus_ (Acts 20:21) = _turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God_ (1 Thess. 1:9). That is just like this mathematical equation, 2+2 = 5-1 = 4.

**Again, _repentance_ is mentioned, but this time with the words, _turned to God from idols_. Then the faith in the Lord Jesus of Acts 20:21 is described in 1 Thess 1:9 as, _serve the living and true God._ It takes _submissive faith_ to follow JESUS, here and now, to have the one and only salvation offered through Jesus Christ. _Mental assent_ to the historical facts of Jesus’ death, burial and resurrection is a DEADLY DISTORTION.** That is not meeting the conditions mentioned in Acts 20:21 and 1 Thess. 1:9\. The so-called Free Grace teaching of our day is demonic. To have Lord JESUS as your Savior and [**eternal life**](http://www.eternallifeblog.com/2012/02/27/what-is-eternal-life/ "What Is Eternal Life"), you must turn away from your idols (sins) and have a faith in JESUS (as the sole object of your faith) that will follow and obey God. See also Heb. 5:9; 1 John 2:3,4; 1 Cor. 6:9,10; etc. In light of these [_**words of life**_](http://www.eternallifeblog.com/2011/10/15/words-eternal-life/ "Words of Eternal Life"), do you really _believe in the Lord Jesus_ as it was understood in Acts 16:31?


## Gal. 5:24 = _Believe in the Lord Jesus_

_Believe in the Lord Jesus_ is even referred to here:

> **Those who belong to Christ Jesus have [crucified the sinful nature](http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/crucify-the-flesh.htm "Crucify The Flesh")** with its passions and desires. (Gal 5:24)

As 2+2 = 5-1 = 4 = 3+1, how to _belong to Christ Jesus_ also = _believe in the Lord Jesus_, but to **_belong to Christ Jesus you must crucify the sinful nature (flesh) with its passion and desires._** That is another way of referring to _repentance,_ which coincides with Acts 20:21 and 1 Thess. 1:9.


## The POWERLESS and WORTHLESS Counterfeits

Anything other than the proper scriptural understanding of believe in the Lord Jesus will not bring about the radical spiritual transformation in a person’s life. People with such a false profession merely have empty words. In contrast, if acted upon, the truth will set one [**free from his sin addictions**](http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans6.htm "Freed From Sin Addictions"), as occurs at the real point of being born again (John 3:3-7). Such [_**powerless gospels**_](http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/form-of-godliness.htm "Form Of Godliness") in our day are called:

-   _free grace_
-   _easy believism_
-   oppose _Lordship salvation_
-   believe babies are born again at [_**infant baptism**_](http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/infantbaptism.htm "Infant Baptism") (as in [_**Catholicism**_](http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/catholic.htm "Former Roman Catholic") and the Lutheran church)
-   etc.


## In Conclusion

**By comparing scripture with scripture, we can ascertain what _believe in the Lord Jesus_ meant nearly 2,000 years ago when preached by the Lord’s followers – one that will give needed results.**
