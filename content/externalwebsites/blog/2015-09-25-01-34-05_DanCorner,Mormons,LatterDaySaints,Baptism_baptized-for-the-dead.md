## Why Are People _Baptized For The Dead_

## [This Is Why There Is NO Need To Pray About The Book Of Mormon](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon.htm)

**How important is _baptized for the dead_ (1 Cor. 15:29) to a Mormon?** Oftentimes when a Mormon is trying to defend his own unique beliefs or destroy the faith of a [**Bible**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)believer, that Mormon will bring up _baptism for the dead_, as it is mentioned in **1 Cor. 15:29**\. Here is how that text reads:

> Else what shall they do which are **baptized for the dead**, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then **baptized for the dead?** (KJV)

[![Karen Carpenter](../../files/pictures/karen-carpenter.jpg "Karen Carpenter was baptized for the dead by Mormonism via baptism by proxy.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormon.html)

It is very easy for a Christian to answer this Mormon question about _baptism for the dead_ after examining the immediate context, that is, verses 29 and 30:

> Else what shall **they** do which are **baptized for the dead**, if the dead rise not at all? why are **they** then **baptized for the dead**? And why stand **we** in jeopardy every hour? (1 Cor 15:29,30)


## "They" Baptized For The Dead

Please notice the contrasting pronouns **_they_** and **we** in 1 Cor. 15:29,30\. The pronoun _they_ refers to the ones believing in and practicing **_baptism for the dead**,_ while **the pronoun _we_ refers to the Christian group that Paul identifies himself with**. In other words, that passage refers to _baptism for the dead,_ but **it was not practiced by Christians. It was done by the non-Christian people in Paul’s day and not the group Paul identified himself with!** This also explains why there is _never_ any other reference to _baptism for the dead_ anywhere else in God’s Word, the Holy Bible.

## Mormon Mythology

The Mormons have nothing to draw from for the details of this strange doctrinal distinctive (_baptism for the dead_). Hence, they must depart from the **[all-sufficient Bible](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html)**, which is obvious error in itself:

> All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be **thoroughly equipped** for every good work. (2 Tim 3:16,17)

**Such has resulted in people being _baptized for the dead_ and _baptism by proxy_. One example is Karen Carpenter. _After she died,_ the Latter Day Saints by proxy have baptized Karen Carpenter, the singer who passed away in 1983. Other famous people were similarly baptized. This is done in a Mormon Temple and the people baptized by proxy will have a special opportunity, because of it, for _salvation!_ That is why Mormonism practices _baptism for the dead_.** (Of course, none of those details or benefits are found in the Bible anywhere and the _salvation_ they speak of is not the same as Biblical salvation.)


## _Baptized For The Dead_ In Summary

Sometimes the false religions will bring up some strange doctrine/s and because Bible-believers are not acquainted with the Scriptures, they are thrown into confusion. Too often it is much worse than merely being thrown into confusion, that is, the gullible, naive and exploitable do get deceived into the [**Latter Day Saints**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormon.html) group, which also ludicrously believes in God the Mother, that Jesus is the Spirit-brother of _Lucifer_, that God was once a man and man can become God, [**baptism is necessary for salvation**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/baptism.html), etc. It is vitally important that we all recognize [**Joseph Smith Jr**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mormons.html). for who he was based on Scripture. His true identity is _false prophet_ and _deceiver_ (Mt.24:11):

 **Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people.**

There is no need to pray about the [**Book of Mormon**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-mormon-1.html) or the LDS church. We don’t _lack knowledge_ about either or its founder. Since they are so different and contrary to the Bible, the real Holy Spirit (who gave us the Bible) can’t be leading or directing them. Do not be deceived by their _baptism for the dead_ practice. It is not Christian.
