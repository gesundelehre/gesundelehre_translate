## The Real _Jehovah's Witnesses Beliefs_ And Their ERRORS

In a six page tract published by the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society (WBTS), entitled _What Do Jehovah's Witnesses Believe?_ a select few of their teachings are mentioned. Among other things, the reader should be aware of the following:

(1) The **[Jehovah's Witnesses](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html)** vehement denial of the **[deity of Christ](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/God-in-the-flesh.htm)** is NOT based on Scripture. They magnify the **[humanity of Christ](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/humanity-of-christ.html)** while avoiding or distorting other Scriptures which affirm the deity of Christ.[![christian beliefs in christianity humanity of christ](../../files/pictures/humanity-of-christ-deity.jpg "christian beliefs in christianity humanity of christ")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/humanity-of-christ.html) For example, Jesus' stated, after His resurrection, that he has all 100% _authority_ or _power_ in Heaven and on earth (Mt. 28:18). Notice: **Jesus**, not the Father, **has all _authority_ in Heaven!** Remember, Jesus humbled himself when he came to the earth, taking the very nature of a servant, even though his nature is _God_ (Phil. 2:5-8).

(2) The Jehovah's Witnesses (Jehovah's Witnesses) have their own Bible translation called the _**[New World Translation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/nwt.html)**_ (NWT), which has inconsistently translated the Greek word which shows that Jesus received _worship_ from His disciples. In that translation, if it can be properly called such, Jesus is said to have received "obeisance" and not "worship." Among other places, please see Mt. 28:9\. That same Greek word found there is properly translated at other passages as "worship" in their Greek English Interlinear called the _Kingdom Interlinear Translation_ (1969 edition). **To be exact, in Mt. 2:11; 14:33; 28:9 and 28:17 the Greek word is translated _obeisance_ because it refers to the Lord Jesus, but when the same exact Greek word is used at Rev. 5:14; 7:11; 11:16; 19:4; 20:4 and Jn. 4:20 it is rendered _worshiped_ because it doesn't refer to Jesus**. This is not good scholarship, neither is it being consistent, as they claim in the foreword of their translation.

<big>**[Jehovah's Witnesses Beliefs Include Everlasting Life Is ONLY For JWs](#jehovah's%20witnesses%20beliefs)**</big> 

(3) Another striking characteristic of the NWT is their usage of "Jehovah." They have done this over 6,000 times in their Bible! But in other literature that they have published, they have gone on record as stating that _Yahweh_ is "the more correct way" to render God's name! Their actual quote is:

> While inclining to view the pronunciation "Yahweh" as **the more correct way,** we have retained the form "Jehovah" **because of people's familiarity with it since the 14th century** (The Kingdom Interlinear Translation of the Greek Scriptures (KIT), 1969 ed., p. 23).

Furthermore, they admit that no one ever used the Latinized word "Jehovah" until the thirteenth century. **This word is of Catholic origin:**

> By combining the vowel signs of _'Adho<font size="-1"><sup>.</sup></font>nay_ and _'Elo<font size="-1"><sup>.</sup></font>him'_ with the four consonants of the Tetragrammaton the pronunciations _Y<font size="-1"><sup>e</sup></font>ho<font size="-1"><sup>.</sup></font>wah'_ and _Y<font size="-1"><sup>e</sup></font>howih'_ were formed. The first of these provided the basis for **the Latinized form "Jehova(h)." The first recorded use of this form dates from the thirteenth century C.E. Raymundus Martini, a Spanish monk of the Dominican Order,** used it in his book _Pugeo Fidei_ of the year **1270\. Hebrew scholars generally favor "Yahweh" as the most likely pronunciation (_Aid to Bible Understanding_, 1971, pp. 884, 885).**(26)

(4) Another unique characteristic of the Jehovah's Witnesses belief system is their strange view that only **[144,000](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/144000.html)** will enter Heaven. Please know that the 12,000 from the 12 tribes of Israel (equaling 144,000) as mentioned in Rev. 7:4-8 and 14:1-3 **does not state that they will be the only ones that will enter Heaven!** Only 144,000 going to heaven is not basic Bible **[Christian beliefs](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-beliefs.html)**!

Let's take a look at two passages by focusing in on the words "**before the throne**":

> Then I looked, and there before me was the Lamb, standing on Mount Zion, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads. (Rev 14:1) And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of rushing waters and like a loud peal of thunder. The sound I heard was like that of harpists playing their harps. (Rev 14:2) And they sang a new song **before the throne** and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. (Rev 14:3)

The second passage is:

> After this I looked and there before me was **a great multitude that no one could count**, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing **before the throne** and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. (Rev 7:9) And they cried out in a loud voice: "Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb." (Rev 7:10) All the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell down on their faces before the throne and worshiped God, (Rev 7:11) saying: "Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength be to our God for ever and ever. Amen!" (Rev 7:12) Then one of the elders asked me, "These in white robes - who are they, and where did they come from?" (Rev 7:13) I answered, "Sir, you know." And he said, "These are they who have come out of the great tribulation; they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. (Rev 7:14) Therefore, "they are **before the throne** of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them. (Rev 7:15)

**Please note, according to Rev. 14:1-3, the 144,000 are "before the throne." If they are in Heaven, then there are many others in Heaven as well because that same phrase "before the throne" is also found in 7:9 and refers to a great multitude that no man can count, which is a different group from the 144,000!**

Further, please remember this: the Jehovah's Witnesses take part of the Rev. 14:1-3 passage literally and part of it figuratively. In other words, the number they take literally but they figuratively interpret the Israelite tribes to mean something other than Israelite tribes!

The Lord Jesus taught:

> Whoever serves me must follow me; and **where I am, my servant also will be**. My Father will honor the one who serves me. (John 12:26)

From the above passage, **Jesus taught that all of his _servants_ will be in the same place as he is! Hence, since Jesus is in Heaven, all of his servants, which certainly exceeds 144,000, will be in Heaven with him, according to Jesus himself!**

(5) While Jehovah's Witnesses call themselves "Christians," the reader should be advised that not everyone who says, "Lord, Lord" will enter into the kingdom of God (Mt. 7:21). Moreover, the Jehovah's Witnesses fail the test to identify themselves as being "in the faith." In 2 Cor. 13:5, we read:

> Examine yourselves to see whether you are **in the faith**; test yourselves. Do you not realize that **Christ Jesus is in you** - unless, of course, you fail the test? (2 Cor 13:5)

Since the Jehovah's Witnesses wrongly teach that Jesus is Michael the Archangel, without any clear Scriptural backing, and since an angel cannot dwell in multitudes of Christians at the same time, then their view of Christ is not only wrong but they would _fail_ the doctrinal test to be _in the faith!_

## _Jehovah's Witnesses Beliefs_ Include Everlasting Life Is ONLY In Jehovah's Organization

(6) So what do Jehovah's Witnesses want from you and what do they believe about salvation? Let the following quote from their own literature answer this:

> Do not conclude that there are different roads, or ways, that you can follow to gain life in God's new system. There is only one. There was just the one ark that survived the Flood, not a number of boats. And there will be only one organization - God's visible organization - that will survive the fast-approaching "great tribulation." It is simply not true that all religions lead to the same goal. (Matthew 7:21-23; 24:21) **You must be part of Jehovah's organization,** doing God's will, **in order to receive his blessing of everlasting life**. - Psalm 133:1-3\. (_You Can Live Forever In Paradise On Earth_, 1982, p. 255.)

The Jehovah's Witnesses want you to spread their false teachings, just as they themselves do. **Furthermore, their own literature clearly states you _must_ be part of their organization to receive _everlasting life_, as you just read.** Finally, the JW religion is based on the teachings of a Bible-defined false prophet from their first president, C. T. Russell, on through to the present time. Though they claim the light gets brighter and brighter, their own prophetic track record has consistently remained the same, that is, one false prophecy after another after another! They have made prophecies that have failed about the following years: 1914, 1915, 1918, 1925, 1931, 1941, 1975 and 1995\. Though the Jehovah's Witnesses claim they "admit their mistakes," they refuse to _admit_ their 1975 false prophecy (or "mistake" as they call it). **A true prophet does not make false prophecies** (Jer. 28:9)!

The Lord Jesus warned that false prophets would arise and would "deceive" many people (Mt. 24:11, 24). Dear reader, don't allow yourself to be a victim of this organization, which is a _ravenous wolf in sheep's clothing_ (Mt. 7:15) but claims of itself to be _Jehovah's organization._

Those who will, in the end, enter God's kingdom have a trusting, submitting and enduring faith in Jesus Christ for salvation. Furthermore, such faith in Christ produces holy living and good fruit. True Christian salvation equals being set free from sin addictions (Rom. 6:22)! And all those "in the truth" of real Christianity can wholeheartedly agree with the Apostle Thomas who called Jesus both his Lord and his God (Jn. 20:28). For more information, contact:

## _Jehovah's Witnesses Beliefs_ Are Not Christian Beliefs

Mr./Ms. Jehovah's Witness, don't be deceived by the Watch Tower!

Please notice the picture at the beginning of the tract, "What do Jehovah's Witnesses Believe?" One woman is giving another what the JW’s call a home Bible Study. Look closely at the picture. The book shown is not the Bible but a Watch Tower publication. Also notice the brief case in the teaching woman’s lap. These brief cases that the JW’s carry are always full of WT publications. The JW’s claim that one cannot find or know the truth by reading the Bible alone. How does this claim compare with what God has stated in 2 Tim. 3:16,17?

> **All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be thoroughly equipped for every good work.**

Note that in the first paragraph of the second section on page 2 of their tract they only quote 2 Tim. 3:16, omitting verse 17 because it does not agree with their belief. It states that God’s word, the Bible, alone is completely sufficient.

In the last paragraph on page 2 of their tract is quoted John 6:57\. A common practice of the WT is to pick a few select verses out of context to support their claims and beliefs. An example of this is found right here. In Chapter 6 of John, verse 51 it shows that IF you are a true believer Christ dwells within you. The JW’s reject this clear teaching. (Please see also 1 Jn. 5:12,13; 1 Cor. 3:16; 1 Jn. 4:4; 2 Cor. 6:14-16).

Why do the Jehovah's Witnesses use their own Bible? The reason is that it has many changes that are not in agreement with the original Greek and Hebrew text, but was made to be in agreement with their unique beliefs. What does God say in his word, the Bible, will happen to those who add, subtract and change words from the Bible (Rev. 22:18)?

> I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.

In reference to their quoting Mt. 6:9 and Jn. 17:6 in the first complete paragraph of page 3 of this tract and to their stating that Jesus prayed to the Father, ask yourself the following question: Why did Jesus allow and not reproach Stephen, who prayed specifically to him (Acts 7:59)?

> While they were stoning him, Stephen prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."

On page 3 of their tract in the second paragraph, the WT quotes Rev. 1:5\. In the immediately preceding verse (4), who is "him who is and was and who is to come," and where is he seated? Does God the Father share his throne with a lesser God? Note the NWT indicates that Jesus is a lesser God, "a god," in John 1:1\. (See Isa. 42:8.)

In the second paragraph of page 3 of their tract, the WT states that Jesus is appointed invisible King. What Bible verses show this and how does this compare with his physical, visible return (Rev. 1:7 cf. Mt. 26:63,64)?

At the end of the first paragraph of page 4 the WT quotes Rev. 14:1,3 to try to support that only 144,000 people will enter heaven. Do all Jehovah's Witnesses who claim to be of the 144,000 meet the requirements outlined in the next two verses, verses 4 and 5 of this chapter? Should a believer trying to understand God's truths read all of this chapter in context to get the full meaning? Who decides what is to be taken as literal or figurative, the WT or the guidance of the Holy Spirit? (1 Jn. 2:27; Jn. 16:13)

Remembering that the WT has made prophecies that have failed about the following years: 1914, 1915, 1918, 1925, 1931, 1941, 1975 and 1995, ask yourself the question, "Why has the WT Society continued to falsely prophesy about Jesus' return, when not even the Son (Jesus Christ) knows the date and hour?"

The WT references Mark 12:31 in the second paragraph of page 5 of their tract and states that they are "widely noted for the love that is manifested among our Christian brothers," the key word being "our." The Bible states love for our "neighbor." What are the Jehovah's Witnesses doing to show their love for those outside of their own organization?

The WT references Acts 15:28-29 in the second paragraph of page 2 of their tract, to support their teaching against blood transfusions used to save lives. When one reads all of the chapter for each reference to the use of blood it becomes apparent that these are in reference to the blood of sacrifices to idols, not for saving human lives. Reference what the Bible says about intent versus tradition in Lk. 14:5\.

On page 6 in the first paragraph of their tract, the WT quotes Jn. 5:28,29 as the Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the unsaved simply die rather than going to eternal punishment in Hell, why according to vs. 29 will the unsaved dead be raised during the judgment, to be informed that they will continue to be dead?

The WT quotes Mt. 24:36-39 in the second paragraph of page 6 of their tract. Why do the Jehovah's Witnesses quote this as their belief, especially vs. 36, when they have continued to disregard this council by having a long documented history of false prophecies? Why also do the Jehovah's Witnesses state verse 39 if they believe that Christ has already returned invisibly? Have the events mentioned in verse 40 which happen at Christ's return happened yet?

The WT quotes 2 Peter 3:5-7, 13 in the second paragraph of page 6 of their tract. Note again according to verse 7 the judgment of those already dead.

The WT quotes Rev. 7:9, 13-15; 21:1-5 in the second paragraph of page 6 of their tract. Verses 21:1-5 indicate that God will dwell with men. Is this what the WT teaches about the paradise on earth? Who is the first and last spoken of in the next verse, Jesus or Jehovah? Reference verses 22:12-13: is Jehovah coming soon to judge mankind or is Jesus?
