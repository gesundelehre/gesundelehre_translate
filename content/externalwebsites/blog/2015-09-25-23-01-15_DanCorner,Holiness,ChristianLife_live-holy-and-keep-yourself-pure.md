## You Can _Live Holy_

<big><big>**[QUESTION: Why Should YOU Hide God's Word In Your Heart](#resist%20the%20devil%20live%20holy)**</big></big>


[![keep yourself pure](../../files/pictures/live-holy-life.jpg "Keep yourself pure and live holy")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/holiness-preaching.html)


**Is it possible for a _righteous_ person to successfully _resist the devil_ and live in such a way that he is _not_ walking in wickedness but is _obeying God?_** In other words, **is it possible for a person who has been _born again_ to keep himself _pure_ and spiritually _clean_ in this sin-filled world rampant with evil people, demons and false teachings?** The answer is **a definite _yes_**, according to Scripture. You can live holy and _keep yourself pure._ You can _resist the devil._ You can keep God's word!

[![live holy keep yourself pure](../../files/pictures/crucify-the-flesh-repentance-spiritual-death.jpg "Crucify the flesh not the physical body.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/crucify-the-flesh.html)

> I know your deeds. See, I have placed before you an open door that no one can shut. I know that you have little strength, yet **you have kept my word** and have not denied my name. (Rev 3:8)

> Therefore, my dear friends, as **you have always obeyed--not only in my presence, but now much more in my absence**--continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling, (Phil 2:12)



## _Resist The Devil and Live Holy_

1\. We are told to _resist_ the devil (the Tempter) and he will _flee:_

> Submit yourselves, then, to God. **Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.** (James 4:7)

● The [**devil**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html), who is trying to deceive us into sin, can be resisted successfully. **If he is resisted he will _flee_ from the one resisting him.** Jesus was tempted by the devil, resisted him and never sinned. **How did the Lord resist the devil victoriously? He did it by giving the devil the word of God and not mentally entertaining his temptations.** See Luke 4:1-13\. Similarly, a _righteous_ person doesn’t have to yield to the devil’s temptations and sin. He can _resist the devil_ and remain submitted to God. **Hence, you do not have to sin. You can be [victorious over sexual temptation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sexualtemptation.htm) and all others!**



## Walk In The Spirit To _Live Holy_

2\. Walk or live by the Spirit and you will _not_ gratify your sinful nature (or flesh):

> So I say, **live by the Spirit, and you will <u>not</u> gratify the desires of the sinful nature.** (Gal. 5:16)

● **The sinful nature must be dealt with and put to _death_**. You can successfully put to death the sinful nature with the help of the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:13b). If you walk (or live) in the Spirit you will not fulfill the desires of the sinful nature. **Hence, you do not have to sin. You can _live holy_ and keep yourself pure.**



## Temptation And Sin

3a. Before a righteous person can sin and die spiritually, he is first _tempted:_

>But each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and **sin**, when it is full-grown, **gives birth to death. Don’t be deceived**, my dear brothers. (James 1:14-16)

[![live holy holiness unforgiveness](../../files/pictures/temptation-of-unforgiveness.jpg "To be in unforgiveness is NOT holy living or keeping yourself pure.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/forgive.html)

That process is first the _temptation_, then the _sin_, then _[**spiritual death**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)_. **If we can eliminate or even reduce _temptation_, we will also lessen the possibility of sinning.** The Lord commanded the disciples to pray for such:

> And **lead us not into temptation,** but deliver us from the evil one. (Matt. 6:13)

● **We should pray daily to be led away from temptation.** See also Mt. 26:41 and Luke 22:40,46\. Dear reader, if you aren’t doing this, **change immediately.** We are in a _serious_ **all-out-fight against sin. It is a [fight to the death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/crucify-the-flesh.html)**:

> In your **struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.** (Heb. 12:4)

**We are in a life-or-death _struggle_ against sin and must _overcome._** We have been told how to _overcome_ and given the ability, through God, to do this. It is now our choice to act and do the right (wise) things to _live holy_ and _obey_. Remember, we can _resist the devil!_ We, as Christians, have also been told what _not_ to do regarding sin:

> Therefore **do not let sin reign in your mortal body** so that you obey its evil desires. (Rom. 6:12)

Why should we not allow sin to reign in our mortal bodies, which is a possibility? Among other reasons, you can become its _slave_ again:

> Don’t you know that when you offer yourselves to someone to obey him as slaves, **you are slaves to the one whom you obey**— whether you are slaves to **sin, which leads to death**, or to obedience, which leads to righteousness? (Rom. 6:16)

**It is possible to conform to evil desires _again_ just like we did before we were _born again:_**

> As obedient children, **do not conform to the evil desires you had when you lived in ignorance.** But just as he who called you is holy, so **be holy in all you do;** (1 Pet. 1:14,15)

How serious is conforming to evil desires?

> If they have escaped the corruption of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and** are again entangled in it** and overcome, they are **worse off at the end than they were at the beginning. It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness**, than to have known it and then to turn their backs on the sacred command that was passed on to them. Of them the proverbs are true: “**A dog returns to its vomit**,” and, “**A sow that is washed goes back to her wallowing in the mud.**” (2 Pet.2:20-22)



## God Is Faithful

3b. We are clearly told that** _never_ will a temptation come to a Christian that will be irresistible. We will always be able to withstand temptation and not yield to sin:**

> No temptation has seized you except what is common to man. And **[God is faithful](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/Gods-faithfulness.htm); he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear.** But when you are tempted, **he will also provide a way out so that you can stand up under it.** (1 Cor. 10:13)

● **Those who have been deceived into thinking Christians must sin all the time are really denying _the faithfulness of God,_ among other precious truths**. God is a faithful God, which includes the above sure promise that _never_ will a temptation come to a Christian that he can’t stand up to and successfully resist. **Hence, you do not have to sin.**

## Hide God's Word In Your Heart

4\. Hide God’s word in your heart to prevent sinning:

[![keep yourself pure](../../files/pictures/PSALM119.JPG "keep yourself pure")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/safegard.html)

> **I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you**. (Psa. 119:11)

● The Godly writer of that verse was serious about not sinning and therefore **_aggressively_ hid God’s word in his heart to prevent such.** Reading, rereading, pondering, meditating in and memorizing God’s word (the Bible) will **prevent sinning**. This is a fact, [**spiritual safeguard**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/safegard.html) and also related to the following Scripture:

> Those who live according to the sinful nature have their minds set on what that nature desires; but **those who live in accordance with the Spirit have their minds set on what the Spirit desires.** (Rom. 8:5)

To have your mind set on what the Spirit desires is to have your mind thinking about the message of the Bible. **This in turn will affect your _behavior_ in a good way.** According to Psalm 1:2,3, a person who meditates in Scripture day and night will always be spiritually _fruitful_ and _prosperous_. **Hence, you do not have to sin.**



## Keep Yourself Pure, LIVE HOLY, Resist The Devil

[![hide God's word in your heart](../../files/pictures/ZERO.JPG "hide God's word in your heart")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/holiness-preaching.html)

5\. We can keep ourselves spiritually _pure_ and from sinful defilements as others have successfully done. Paul did this:

> The goal of this command is love, which comes from **a pure heart** and a good conscience and a sincere faith. (1 Tim. 1:5)

Paul had a **pure heart**, a good conscience and sincere faith, unlike how the **[eternal security teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html)** slander him (and the normal Christian life) as doing evil all the time.

Paul also believed Timothy had **a pure heart:**

Do not share in the sins of others. **Keep yourself pure**. (1 Tim. 5:22)

Paul knew Timothy could **keep himself _pure_** and **not share in the sins of others.** It was his responsibility to do so. God wasn’t going to do it automatically for him.

> <u>**Flee**</u> the evil desires of youth, and <u>**pursue**</u> righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord out of **a pure heart**. (2 Tim. 2:22)

Others besides Timothy and Paul had a _pure_ heart and the same were also pursuing _righteousness, faith, love and peace_.

> Dear friends, now we are children of God, and **what we will be has not yet been made known.** But we know that **when he appears, we shall be like him**, for we shall see him as he is. Everyone who has this hope in him **purifies himself**, just as he is pure. (1 John 3:2, 3)

Keep the above _hope_ in yourself. Such will help you to walk _pure_.

> These are those who did not defile themselves with women, for **they kept themselves pure**. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. (Rev. 14:4)

These also kept themselves _pure_. **Hence, you do not have to sin.**



## True Christianity

**James tells us about true Christianity:**

> Religion that God our Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their distress and **to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.** (James 1:27)

● Hence, **we do not have to be spiritually polluted by the world**. This is also necessary to have the religion (Christianity) which God accepts. **Hence, you do not have to sin.**



## Pray To Stand Firm

Christians should pray for others to stand firm in God’s will:

> Epaphras, who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends greetings. He is always wrestling in prayer for you, **that you may stand firm in all the will of God,** mature and fully assured. (Col. 4:12)

> We are glad whenever we are weak but you are strong; and our prayer is for your perfection. (2 Cor. 13:9)

Pray also for yourself, as the Psalmist did for himself:

> Direct my footsteps according to your word; **let no sin rule over me**. (Psa. 119:133)

At this point, David was spiritually clean:

> Though you probe my heart and examine me at night, though you test me, **you will find nothing**; I have resolved that **my mouth will not sin**. (Psa. 17:3)

You can also be like Paul and **_beat your body and make it your slave_** (1 Cor. 9:27) and the minority of Christians at Sardis whom Jesus described as follows:

> Yet you have **a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes.** They will walk with me, dressed in white, for **they are worthy.** He who **overcomes** will, like them, be dressed in white. I will never blot out his name from the **[book of life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/book-of-life.html)**, but will acknowledge his name before my Father and his angels. **He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.** (Rev. 3:4-6)

To be _worthy_ to walk with Jesus means you will have to **keep your spiritual clothes from getting soiled by sin**. You can do it, with God’s help and by applying the above vital spiritual truths. **Hence, you do not have to sin. You can live _holy_. You can _obey_ God now in this lifetime. Don’t let anyone _deceive_ you—righteous people (Christians) _do_ what is right and such are distinguished from the _sinful_ (the non-Christians):**

> Dear children, do not let anyone lead you astray. <u>**He who does what is right is righteous**</u>, just as he is righteous.  <u>**He who does what is sinful is of the devil**</u> (1 John 3:7,8)

[**Sin can defile, contaminate, soil and bring a Christian to _his spiritual death_**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html). Therefore, **sin is spiritual _poison_ to one’s soul.** It is a must to keep away from such as it would be to avoid eating and drinking _poison_ in your food. Jesus clearly identified the _Christians_ with these words:

> He replied, “My mother and brothers are those who hear God’s word and **put it into practice**.” (Luke 8:21)

To put God’s word into practice is not to sin—it is to _obey._ Christians** _obey,_ while the non-Christians _sin._ Don’t be deceived:**

> “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but **only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven**.” (Matt. 7:21)

> Those who have **done good** will rise to **live**,  and those who have **done evil** will rise to be **condemned**. (John 5:29)

Paul taught the same in these words:

> To those who by **persistence in doing good** seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give **eternal life**.  But for those who are self-seeking and who reject the truth and **follow evil**, there will be **wrath and anger**. (Rom. 2:7,8)

The heretical eternal security teachers want us to believe Christians sin the same way as the non-Christians (adultery, theft, murder, hate, swindling, lying, drunkenness, etc.) but their sins can’t bring them to their spiritual death or negate their salvation. In other words, _disobedience_ to God’s commands won’t bring spiritual death—**the same message the _devil_ taught Eve in Eden**. See Gen. 3:4\. When Christians oppose the eternal security teachers the essence of their message is **the same as God’s to Adam:**

> “You must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, for when you eat of it **you will surely die.**” (Gen. 2:17)

Scripture identifies all eternal security proponents who think they know God in a salvation way yet are sinning as **_liars:_**

> We know that we have come to know him **if we <u>obey</u> his commands.** The man who says, “I know him,” but **<u>does not do what he commands</u> is a <u>liar</u>, and the truth is not in him.** (1 John 2:3,4)

Jesus spoke of the vital importance of **heart purity:**

> **Blessed** are **the pure in heart, for they will see God**. (Matt. 5:8)



## You Can't _Mock_ God

**Don’t be deceived—living _holy_ is a _salvation issue_ and nothing less:**

Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked. A man reaps what he sows.  **The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction;  the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.** Let us not become weary in <u>**doing good**</u>, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest <u>**if we do not give up**</u>. (Gal. 6:7-9)

**You must _continue_ and _not give up doing good_ to reap _eternal life_, according to true _grace_ teaching. If you give up and start to please the sinful nature you will _not_ reap eternal life—you will go to _hell_. Do not be deceived. Do not let the [heresy of eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) drag you and your loved ones down to hell. Resist the devil and his lies. This is all part of [Christian beliefs](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-beliefs.html) though too little known.**



## True Grace = LIVE HOLY

**The real grace of God which brings _salvation_ is described in Titus 2:11,12:**

> For **the grace of God that brings salvation** has appeared to all men. It teaches us to say **“No” to ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright and godly lives in this present age,** (Titus 2:11,12)

That is not the _grace_ taught by the dangerous eternal security teachers. Their counterfeit grace message is the same as the devil’s lie in Gen. 3:4\. Again, you can keep yourself pure! The eternal security teachers and their message are both described in Jude 4:

> For certain men whose **condemnation** was written about long ago have secretly slipped in among you. They are **godless men**, who **change the grace of our God into a license for immorality** and deny Jesus Christ our only Sovereign and Lord.
