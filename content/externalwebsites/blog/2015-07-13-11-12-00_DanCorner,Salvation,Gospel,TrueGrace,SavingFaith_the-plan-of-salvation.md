## What Is The Gospel of Jesus Christ?

**_What is the gospel of Jesus Christ_? ANSWER: The _gospel of Jesus Christ_ is the same as the _bible plan of salvation_ and the bible plan of salvation is how a person finds forgiveness of his sins, becomes born again and a new creation in Christ. Unfortunately, there are many [**false gospels**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/anothergospel.html) and distorted salvation truths. That makes this subject most important. In fact, there is not a close second to the study of the biblical _plan of salvation_.** Though the term _salvation_ can be used in different ways, here it refers to **_deliverance from damnation in the fires of hell._** **This is the only way this important term will be used in this teaching.**

## _Jesus_, God's Religious Leader and _Gospel_ Preacher

**Of all the major religious leaders, the one and only reliable spiritual authority is the Lord Jesus.** All others were/are counterfeits and therefore have dangerously misled their following. This list includes Buddha, Mohammed, Confucius, Zoroaster, Dalai Lama, the [**Pope**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/papal.html)**,** etc.

[![salvation](../../files/pictures/how-to-reap-eternal-life.jpg "The gospel of Jesus Christ is the plan of salvation. It is the same gospel taught by his apostles.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternallife.html)

## Jesus and The _Plan of Salvation_

[![gospel of Jesus Christ](../../files/pictures/gospel-of-Jesus-Christ.jpg "Early Christian life centered around the teachings of Jesus Christ and especially his gospel.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/Jesusfocus.html)

Regarding _salvation_ (or the _plan of salvation_) **[Jesus pointed people to himself](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/Jesusfocus.html)** with the following vital conditions attached:

> Then he said to them all: “**If anyone would come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me.** For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me will save it. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, and yet lose or forfeit his very self? If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and in the glory of the Father and of the holy angels” (Luke 9:23-26).

Jesus also told people he had a spiritual _yoke_ for us to wear much like oxen or other animals in the natural have that would be working in field and pulling a burden:

> **Take my yoke upon you** and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find **rest for your souls.** For my yoke is easy and my burden is light (Matt. 11:29,30).

**(NOTE: You will never find _rest for your soul_ until you come to Jesus on his terms.) But there is another part to the question, _what is the gospel of Jesus Christ?_ Jesus taught you must turn from sin (repent) or you would _perish_ (in hell's fire):**

> But **unless you repent, you too will all perish** (Luke 13:3).

**Hence, _repenting_ is in the Biblical _plan of salvation_.** You can't get born again without it. In other words, as long as you cleave to the pleasures of sin for a short time (Heb. 11:25) you do not and can not have the salvation which is _only found in the Lord Jesus._ 

![gospel of Jesus Christ](../../files/pictures/eomin.gif "You must endure to the end to be saved.")

Anything else is not the true _plan of salvation._ People who have repented (and become Christians) are described as follows:

> Those who belong to Christ Jesus **have crucified the sinful nature with its passions and desires** (Gal. 5:24).

[![gospel of jesus christ](../../files/pictures/repentance.jpg "The real gospel of Jesus Christ is vital to know.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/repentance.html)

To turn from your wickedness, which is dragging you to hell, and to wisely chose to submissively place Jesus' yoke on yourself to follow and serve him is equated to **_believing on Jesus._** This is also the same as getting _born again._ When a person is born again, he is also forgiven of all of his sins and set free from the **[sin addictions](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans6.html)** he was a slave to (John 8:34-36; Rom. 6:22). In particular, it is contact with [**Jesus' cleansing, precious blood**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesusblood.html) (Rev. 1:5; 1 Pet. 1:19; 1 John 1:7) that brings this **_[new creation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/new-creation.html)_** (2 Cor. 5:17) miracle about.

Getting _born again_ occurs at the point of a trusting-and-submitting faith in Jesus for personal salvation. **All 100% of our _trust_ must be in mankind's only Savior, who is Jesus, to have salvation** (John 14:6; Acts 4:12; etc.). Again, **Jesus must be _the focus_ of our faith.** (Many have, unfortunately, been deceived into lethally trusting church membership, [**water baptism**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/baptism.html)**,** [**Mary**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mother-of-Jesus.html)**,** [**Saturday Sabbath**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sabbath.htm) keeping, Lodge membership, wearing the [**brown scapular**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/brown-scapular.html)**,** etc., for salvation. Some others are _trusting in Jesus partly_ and in someone else or some other thing also for their salvation. **They also have been dangerously misled.)**

**VERY IMPORTANT: The Bible refers to the term _salvation_, or a derivative of it, such as _saved,_ in two different ways.** At times it is used in reference to _initial salvation_ and at other times for _final salvation_. **(Initial salvation refers to the point of getting saved or being _born again_ while final salvation refers to _an actual entrance into God's kingdom_ after physical death.)**


<a name="verses"></a>
## _The Gospel of Jesus Christ_ Verses

[![gospel of Jesus Christ](../../files/pictures/GOSPEL-of-Jesus-Christ.png "Which gospel is the real gospel of Jesus Christ? You must examine all the scriptures to know.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/whichgospel.htm)

A few examples of _**initial salvation verses**_:

> Jesus said to the woman, “Your faith has **saved** you; go in peace” (Luke 7:50)

> He then brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be **saved?"** They replied, "**[Believe in the Lord Jesus](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/believing.html)**, and you will be **saved** - you and your household" (Acts 16:30,31)

> .Jesus said to him, “Today **salvation** has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham” (Luke 19:9).

Examples of _**final salvation verses**_ are shown here:

> Our **salvation** is nearer now than when we first believed (Rom. 13:11).

> All men will hate you because of me, but he who stands firm to the end will be **saved** (Matt. 10:22).

Someone asked him, “Lord, are only a few people going to be **saved?”** He said to them, “Make every effort to **enter through the narrow door,** because many, I tell you, will try to enter and will not be able to” (Luke 13:23, 24).

In this last passage, Jesus answered the question about being _saved_ by mentioning **entering through the kingdom doors.** He also stated we will need _**personal effort**_ **to get in. This is Jesus' teaching, not mine or some other Christian's. That is part of his _plan of salvation._ <u>Jesus taught an instant salvation through repenting and submissively trusting in himself for salvation, but also taught a _continuous effort on man's part_ (to stay spiritually alive) to enter God's kingdom doors.</u>** A raging spiritual battle is going on with the forces of darkness as they try to lead you astray and cause you to fall from grace (Gal. 5:2-4); shipwreck your faith in Jesus (1 Tim. 1:19,20); get you to become immoral, impure and greedy (Eph. 5:5-7); etc.

## [Are YOU Prepared For Death](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/prepare-for-death.html)

When God opens your eyes to these truths, the Bible makes much more sense, especially when studying the words _eternal life._ The salvation-related term _eternal life_ becomes one's personal possession when the repentant starts to follow or believes on Jesus for his soul's salvation or as he turns from idols to serve God (1 Thess. 1:9). This is common knowledge and shown in John 6:47 and elsewhere. But **most importantly, eternal life is shown to be something else, which reflects an aspect of it which you do not now have and only will if you endure to _the end_ through persecution (Mt. 10:22) which will come because of godly living (2 Tim. 3:12), hold firm to _the end_ of your life (Heb. 3:14) and remain faithful to [**Almighty God**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/almighty.html) _until our physical death_ (Rev. 2:10,11).** Paul taught the same in different words:

> The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; **the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap eternal life.** Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest **if we do not give up.** Therefore, as we have opportunity, let us do good to all people, especially to those who belong to the family of believers (Gal. 6:8-10).

**Too many have never heard that declared as part of the _plan of salvation!_** Clearly, [**eternal life**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternallife.html) is also _**reaped**_ but **only by those sowing to please the Spirit of God** (in [**obedience**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/obey.html)**).** Hence, **eternal life is a _hope,_ as shown elsewhere in Scripture** (Titus 1:2; 3:7). 
Jesus taught something about _eternal life_ that is also rarely known in our day:

> The man who loves his life will lose it, while **the man who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life** (John 12:25).

**Between initial and final salvation, there are many spiritual dangers that can interfere with and even curtail your following/believing in Jesus and _salvation_ such as: persecutions, cares of this life, pleasures of this life, becoming and staying lukewarm, not producing good fruit, becoming unforgiving and even through [**lust**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lust.html) and hatred that can creep in. Another very real and extreme spiritual danger is certain false teachers** -- those who misuse [**God's word**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wordgod.html) regarding the _plan of salvation_.

Teaching wrongly about _fasting,_ or about some other non-salvation related subject, is not nearly as serious as false teaching regarding the **plan of _salvation._** The real ravenous wolves in sheep's clothing (Mt. 7:15) are those who teach in a way _contrary_ to getting: (1) Biblically born again or (2) Reaping eternal life by sowing to please the Spirit of God (obedience)—which is the same as actually entering into God's kingdom. This is so because both truths refer to _salvation_.

_Many_ people that do get Biblically _born again_ later (during their long distance spiritual race) _[**die spiritually**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)_ or become _lost_ again by **backsliding** (Mt. 24:9,10). One prime example is found in Jesus' own teaching (Lk. 15:24,32). **There are at least 18 Biblical examples of the named and unnamed people that did _fall away_ from their salvation due to certain sins, believing/teaching a [**false gospel**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/whichgospel.htm) and or by disowning Jesus during persecution for godly living.**

## <a name="warning"></a>Plan of Salvation Warning

In spite of the clarity of these facts shown throughout Scriptures, [**false teachers**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm) want to convince us otherwise. **Of this group, the most deadly false teacher of all for those that have been born again are the _[eternal security teachers](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html)._** Because of the popularity of this doctrine and these teachers often being exalted as spokesmen and apologists for evangelical Christianity, many [**Bible**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible.html) believers just accept their sinister teaching and security-in-sin-with-salvation theology. Such dangerously deceived people are usually very casual readers of Scripture (at best) and just implicitly trust their pastor, radio teachers, etc. for truth instead of reading the New Testament for themselves and putting into practice its life-giving message. Scripture actually says that there are people that will seek out (false) teachers to say what their sinful ears want to hear (2 Tim. 4:2-4).

**The missing part of the plan of salvation in our day, among Bible believers, primarily is: _A true Christian must endure to the end for salvation's sake_** (Mt. 10:22; Heb. 3:14; Rev. 2:10,11). Because many people that receive the gift of salvation don't endure and remain faithful, but some others do, **the only difference can be what they themselves do and believe after getting _born again_.** Many don't even know about final salvation or acting upon the vital [**spiritual safeguards**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/safegard.html) found in Scripture **to _enter_ God's kingdom. Such is foreign to their concept of salvation and the [Christian life](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-life.html)**.

**To refer to any [eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html) teacher as _a ravenous wolf in sheep's clothing_ is not being _unloving_ or _judgmental_. In fact, it is expressing Christian love to all who have ears to hear. It is being Biblical and trying to wake up those who have been deceived by that counterfeit _gospel_ and _grace_ turned into a license for immorality. The one and only real _gospel_ message [focuses on Jesus](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/Jesusfocus.html) and declares this to real Christians:**

> By this gospel you are saved, **IF you hold firmly to the word I preached to you. Otherwise, you have believed in vain** (1 Cor 15:2).

That is a vital part of the real gospel message (_plan of salvation_). There are free will and human responsibilities involved in this salvation by _grace_, according to Scripture.

Furthermore, **_[sin](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sin.html) is still the issue_ since Calvary's cross,** according to true grace teaching. Paul wrote real Christians these facts:

For **if you live according to the sinful nature, you will die;** but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live (Rom. 8:13).

The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. **I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this [**will not inherit the kingdom of God**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/will-not-inherit-the-kingdom-of-God.htm)** (Gal. 5:19-21). See also Mark 9:43-48.

Such important teachings as these can never be correctly termed a _[**works salvation**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/workssalvation.html)**,** legalism_ or _cultic_, but the dangerous and basically unrecognized eternal security _wolves_ want you to think this way! **Those vital teachings about sin's destructive power originated with the Lord and his apostles. They are not new with us. They are connected with the true plan of salvation.**

Two striking points about all eternal security teachers are: (1) While they believe sins will damn a person who has never been saved to hell and teach such needs to be forgiven and _born again_, they also believe **after getting born again he can commit the same sins that were dragging him to [**hell**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hell.html) before getting born again and he retains his _salvation_, even while unrepentant!** That is the DANGEROUS but popular message connected with the counterfeit evangelical _plan of salvation_ in our day. (2) **They are trying to convince us that we can not and do not need to [**live holy**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/keep-yourself-pure.html) and obedient for _salvation_, in blatant disharmony to Scriptures** (Mt. 5:8; Rev. 20:6; Heb. 12:14; etc.). In other words, these _savage wolves in sheep's clothing_ want us to believe that once you get born again you can turn and become [**wicked**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wicked-people-forgiven.html)**,** vile, stray into false doctrine about the gospel, not bring forth good fruit, etc. and never imperil your **[eternal salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/getsaved.html). Such a message has obviously come from demons and the [devil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/devil.html)** himself.

**Sometimes eternal security teachers declare things like: A Christian can't really be obedient; and we all sin all the time; all sin is of the same degree; God doesn't see your sin after initial salvation anyway, since your [future sins are already forgiven before you commit them](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/futuresins.html) and God can only see Jesus' blood when he looks at us. They term this _grace_ when it is a deadly lie and _[doctrine of demons](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/doctrine-of-demons.html)_. If that isn't bad enough these spiritual enemies also slander [Christians](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian.html) in various ways who declare the aforementioned _plan of salvation_ found in God's word.**

**<u>Remember, to enter God's kingdom after death one must become Biblically _born again_ and at the end of his life _die in a spiritually saved condition_, which does not always happen.</u>** Some of the _[**righteous**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/righteous.html)_ have lethally [**backslid**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/backslider.html)**,** temporarily lost their salvation for a time and later returned to God (like [**David**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/king-david-sinned.html) and Peter), while others haven't (like [**Solomon**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/solomons-apostasy.html)**;** [**Judas**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/judas.html)**;** those cited in [**Heb. 6:4-6**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/hebrews.htm) and John 6:66; etc.).



## Endurance and The _Plan Of Salvation_

In other words, **unless you endure, remain faithful to God and hold firmly _till the end_, your getting _born again_ will be useless and you will still get thrown into the lake of fire -- the same as though you were never _born again._ Moreover, you will be _worse off_ at the end than you were before initial salvation (2 Pet. 2:20). You won't ever hear that Bible truth from [Joseph Prince podcasts](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/joseph-prince-destined-to-reign.html), but it is still true! AVOID [Joseph Prince messages](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/joseph-prince-destined-to-reign.html). They are sugar coated poison. More and more Bible believers are becoming aware of these facts about the _plan of salvation_ (or _gospel message_) and spreading this vital information to others for their benefit. Remember Jesus described real _Christians_ as those that hear God's word and _put it into practice_ (Lk. 8:21). That is a concise way to know the real _plan of salvation_. Hopefully, the aforementioned adequately explained _what is the gospel of Jesus Christ_ to where you can now understand it.**
