## Eternal Security (License For Sin) is a TEST To See IF You Love God With ALL Your Heart and Soul

Back in the days of Moses a very surprising **_test_ from God** occurred, which is **similar to one of the spiritual _tests_ we Christians face in our day over _[eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)_**. Please read this over very carefully:

> If a prophet, or one who foretells by [**dreams**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dreams.htm), appears among you and announces to you a [**miraculous sign**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/miracles.html) or wonder, (Deut. 13:1)

> and **if the sign or wonder of which he has spoken takes place**, and he says, **“Let us follow other gods” (gods you have not known) “and let us worship them,”** (Deut. 13:2)

> you must not listen to the words of that prophet or dreamer. **The LORD your God is testing you to find out whether you love him with all your heart and with all your soul.**  (Deut. 13:3)



## False Prophets With TRUE Prophecy Are A TEST!

[![eternal security test](../../files/pictures/wolf.gif "Eternal security is a test from God")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm)

Imagine that! God, who wants all to be saved, would have [**false prophets**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/false.htm) come and accurately predict **an event that would occur**, but those same false prophets would try to lead the Israelites into _sin_. Such was **_a test from God_** to see if they would **_loved God_ with all of their hearts and souls and remain faithful**. (If they **_loved God_** they would **_obey_** him and not worship false gods.)

> **It is the LORD your God you must follow, and him you must revere. Keep his commands and obey him; serve him and hold fast to him.**  (Deut. 13:4)

> **That prophet or dreamer must be put to death,** because he preached rebellion against the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from the land of slavery; **he has tried to turn you from the way the LORD your God commanded you to follow.  **You must purge the <u>evil</u> from among you. (Deut. 13:5)**

Again, the _test_ was: could that false prophet turn the God-worshiping Israelites away from God by accurately announcing an event and then saying **“Let us follow other gods” (gods you have not known) “and let us worship them.”**

> If your very own brother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you love, or your closest friend secretly entices you, saying, **“Let us go and worship other gods”** (gods that neither you nor your fathers have known, (Deut. 13:6)

> gods of the peoples around you, whether near or far, from one end of the land to the other), (Deut. 13:7)

> do not yield to him or listen to him. Show him no pity. Do not spare him or shield him. (Deut. 13:8)

> **You must certainly put him to death**. Your hand must be the first in putting him to death, and then the hands of all the people. (Deut. 13:9)

> Stone him to death, **because he tried to turn you away from the LORD your God,** who brought you out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery. (Deut. 13:10)

> Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and no one among you will do such an **_evil_ thing again. (Deut. 13:11)



## Eternal Security Turns People Away From God

The chief similarity between that type of false prophet in Moses’ day and the ones in our day—the **_eternal security_ teachers—is clear. The message of both tends to turn one _away from the Lord._ **To be more precise—if you accept the false teaching of _[eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)_ you will think you can _sin with absolutely no concern of losing your salvation._  You will think you can sin like David, when in _adultery_ and _murder,_ and still remain saved in such wickedness.**  You will believe if you do go and worship false gods you will remain saved. In other words, **eternal security teaching really is a disguised attack on you _loving_ _God,_ that is, you _obeying_ God.**

The [**eternal security teachers**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security-teachers.html) are constantly trying to convince you that _you can’t obey God_ and that _you must sin against God all the time._ **This is the same as saying you can’t _love_ God with all your heart and soul because you must sin and disobey him.**

Remember also that the eternal security teachers _slander_ the holy [**Apostle Paul by their deadly and false interpretation of Rom. 7:14-25 when they say that passage was Paul as a _Christian_, who was constantly doing _evil_**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/worst-of-sinners.htm)_._ In other words, they teach Paul wasn’t _obeying_ _God_ (or **_loving_** God) and you won’t (can’t) either. Such constant disobedience is the _normal Christian_ life, so they teach. This is why they teach **Christians can be adulterous, drunkards, thieves, liars, sorcerers, murderers, swindlers, slanderers, sodomites, idolaters, etc. the same as unsaved people.**

**The eternal security teachers of our day, therefore, are just like this type of false prophet in Moses’ day. Both are _very dangerous_ people and can _lethally_ destroy one’s _salvation_. TAKE WARNING! Eternal security is a TEST from God.**
