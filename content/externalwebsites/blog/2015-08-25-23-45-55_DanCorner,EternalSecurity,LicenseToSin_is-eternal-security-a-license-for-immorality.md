## Why Do Most Eternal Security Proponents Deny This Truth

As it has often been stated in the past, **eternal security proponents will deny** the truth that their own beloved doctrine is _a license for immorality._ In an effort to escape this apparent truth, one **[eternal security](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)** proponent emailed the following:

> Eternal Security does not teach sin all you want because you're always saved.


## Christian Response About Eternal Salvation

[![license for immorality](../../files/pictures/eternal-security-license-for-immorality.jpg "Eternal security is dripping with a license for immorality AND crushes the fear of God.")](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/etlicense.html)

**[Bible Answer](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/bible-answers.html)**: The teaching of eternal security does not have to proclaim word-for-word: _sin all you want because you’re always saved_. **All it has to do is declare that sin can never endanger one’s _salvation_ — which is exactly the core message of this sinister teaching.**

**Eternal security proponents have no fear or concern about their salvation being jeopardized by any kind of wickedness they would commit.** They all think they can commit **adultery**, get **[drunk](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/drunk.html), lie, steal, slander, be [unforgiving](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/forgive.html), greedy, [lustful](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/lust.html), die a [suicide](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/suicide.html), etc.** without their _salvation_ being lost (though they sometimes loathe to admit this). Hence, for the ones who find real salvation, when the devil tempts them to sin—being oblivious to the truth that the **[righteous can die spiritually](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.html)**—they yield and sin does its destructive work to their _eternal salvation._ **NOTE: eternal salvation is only given to those who OBEY Jesus (Heb. 1:6). That is not the _eternal salvation_ they claim to have!** They apparently know nothing about sin leading to spiritual death:

> Each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. Then, after desire has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and **sin, when it is full-grown, gives birth to death. Don’t be deceived**, my dear brothers (James 1:14-16).

> For if you live according to the sinful nature, **you will die**; but if by the Spirit you put to death the misdeeds of the body, you will live (Rom. 8:13).

## Their Basic Beliefs Imply a License For Immorality

The most foundational so-called **[Christian beliefs](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/christian-beliefs.html)** of the eternal security proponents are twisted and distorted! They don’t care about their loss of rewards, under today’s pressures of life and temptations. This is apparent by their sinfully repugnant behavior. In fact, they also believe: (1) Their **[future sins are all forgiven](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/futuresins.html)** before they even commit them; (2) God cannot see their sins anyway, since all God can see when he looks at the Christian is the **[blood of Jesus](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jesusblood.html)**; and (3) **They will all sin all the time and Paul himslef was the _worst of sinners!_.**

**Hence, their teaching is the indirect declaration of _a license for immorality._** Why should an eternal security proponent even try to _obey_ after such indoctrination? **He has been taught he _can’t_ _obey_ anyway and such doesn’t really matter as far as _salvation_ is concerned.**

## Did You Say _Holy_

If you ever hear a person say that he or some other eternal security proponent he knows is living _holy_, please remind them **such is contrary to their own interpretation of Romans 7:14-20. They openly teach Paul didn’t live _holy._ How then can he expect Christians to believe he or someone he personally knows is living _holy?_ Again, such would be self-defeating because it would oppose their own doctrine.**

Finally, please know that some eternal security teachers, like Bob George, do clearly teach _a license for immorality._ He has openly taught on the radio:

> **So is committing fornication permissible? Yes.**

That is clearly a license for immorality, especially when one observes that **_permissible_ and _license_ are synonyms.**

A different eternal security proponent emailer misrepresented what we have taught about their doctrine in an attempt to discredit our teachings (at least in his own mind):

> You claim eternal security teaches you can live anyway you want to without consequences ....

We don’t present their doctrine in that manner. We have declared numerous times they think **only limited harm is done by their sinning**. In other words, they think their **_salvation_** can _never_ be lost. **They definitely do teach a sinning Christian will lose his _rewards_, fellowship with God, etc.** Their own doctrine causes trouble for them, but few seem to recognize it! Since they think their future sins are already forgiven before they are ever committed, **why will they lose their rewards over sins already forgiven? Also, their own teaching is that God cannot see their sins anyhow. So, if God can’t see their sins, then how can they lose rewards because of sin which God can’t see?**

**Eternal security is the ruination of the [evangelical](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/evangelicals.htm) Bible-believing churches and denominations of our day. Such proponents don't understand [eternal salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/getsaved.html) at all! The sooner it is lethally crushed, the better for everyone. May God raise up a million bold and informed Christians to fight this spiritual gangrene from every angle.** We have much ministry material that can help with this noble cause of destroying the license for immorality of **[once a son always a son](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.html)**. GOD BLESS YOU.
