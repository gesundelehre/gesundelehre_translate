## Who Are The 144,000

<big><big>**[PROOF! There Will Be More Than 144,000 In Heaven](#who%20are%20the%20144,000)**</big></big>

**Only in the Book of Revelation do we read of this special group of 144,000. There is a _mystery_ surrounding them. _Who are the 144,000_ and could some people alive today be of the 144,000? What are the Biblical details? Here are eight known facts:**

![144000](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)They each get a seal on their foreheads (7:3)

![144000](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)They are from the twelve tribes of Israel (7:4-8), that is, 12,000 from each of the 12 tribes.

![144000](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)They get Jesus’ name and the Father’s name written on their foreheads (14:1).<span> 

![144000](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)They were before the throne where they alone could learn a heavenly praise song to sing (14:3).

![144000](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)They were redeemed from the earth, purchased from among men (Rev. 14:3,4) and offered as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb (14:4).

![144000](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)No lie was found in their mouths; they are blameless. (14:5)

![144000](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)They kept themselves pure from defilement with women (14:4).

![144000](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)They are still following JESUS in heaven (14:4)



## Jehovah's Witnesses Beliefs About The 144,000

The Jehovah's Witnesses have been wrongly taught that _only the 144,000 will be in heaven_ and they are all Jehovah's Witnesses! The rest of God’s servants will dwell on paradise earth and not be in heaven. The 144,000 have been "born again" and the ones alive today have a "heavenly hope." In part, for the Jehovah’s Witnesses to come to those false conclusions they must:

![144000](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)_Literally_ take the number (144,000), but reject they are _literal_ Jews as the same text says.

![144000](../../files/pictures/redball.gif)Believe the 144,000 will be in heaven, but deny the great multitude that no man can count in Rev. 7 will also be in heaven, even though both groups are in the **same place described as being** **before the throne:**

And they [144,000] sang a new song **before the throne** and before the four living creatures and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth. (Rev 14:3)

After this I looked and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing **before the throne** and in front of the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. (Rev 7:9)

Therefore, “they are **before the throne** of God and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.” (Rev 7:15)

**Again, since the 144,000 are _before the throne_ and that is in heaven, then the great multitude that no man can count must also in heaven, since they too are _before the throne_! Having said all of that, the answer to the question _who are the 144,000_ is _they are 144,000 Jews_ who will be the first ones martyred during the days of the [antichrist](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/antichrist.html). Hence, all of the 144,000 are of the last generation.**

## More Than 144,000 In Heaven

It is even more clear that the number in heaven with Jesus will definitely **exceed 144,000** and is shown by the following:

Whoever serves me must follow me; and **where I am, my servant also will be.** My Father will honor the one who serves me. (John 12:26)

Jesus stated **_all of his servants_ will be with him!** So, where is he referring to? _Heaven._ This glaring inconsistency about the 144,000 is just another obvious error and more evidence showing the **[Watchtower Society](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/jehovahs-witnesses-answered.html)** in _not_ Jehovah’s Organization, as they have taught their own gullible members. To have true salvation also means one is **[set free from his sin addictions](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/romans6.html)**. The **[plan of salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.html)** taught by the Watchtower Society can never bring that about! **They are also wrong about _who are the 144,000._**
