# Franklin Graham Downplays The Seriousness Of Disowning Jesus

 Posted on December 27, 2014 by Eternal Life Blog (Dan Corner)

**Franklin Graham is following in Billy Graham’s footsteps, which is not good.** The ecumenical [**_Billy Graham Evangelistic Association_**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/billy.htm "Billy Graham") stands on and tries to defend the [**heresy of eternal security**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.htm "eternal security or conditional security"). **Perhaps, that is the reason Billy Graham (and Franklin Graham too) are so ecumenical and must think Catholics, who respond to a salvation prayer at his crusades, should return to the [Catholic church](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/category/catholicism/ "Former Roman Catholic") with all of its dangerous false doctrines and idolatries. Billy Graham apparently thinks they will remain saved in idolatry, which is consistent with his once saved always saved doctrine, but he is dreadfully wrong (Rev. 21:8)**.

**Now Franklin Graham is downplaying the seriousness of disowning (or denying) Jesus Christ before men.** Jesus clearly foretold of that danger and the serious _lethal_ consequences for all who do _disown Jesus._ Contrary to what the popular teachers, and the chief representatives of Christianity in our dark day (like Franklin Graham) say, Jesus taught such disciples would **lose their salvation!** He said:

> But whoever disowns me before men, **I WILL disown him** before my Father in heaven. (Mat 10:33)

**If Jesus disowns one, he is no longer Jesus’ possession and can’t have salvation anymore.** Furthermore, Jesus said he WILL disown such a person. Hence, it is calling Jesus a “liar” to say he won’t _disown_ such a person! Peter did that, but repented afterwards and returned to salvation. Here is how the actual interview went with Franklin Graham:


## Franklin Graham is Wrong

> The Rev. Franklin Graham says Christians should never deny Jesus Christ in order to spare their lives from slaughter by terrorists, such as ISIS, and further asserts that doing so would be **a betrayal against martyrs** who stood strong for their faith, despite persecution.

> **“Christians have been martyred going all the way back to the Romans when they fed them to the lions. We would be betraying every person who stood for their faith, who stood for Jesus Christ, if we turn our back on Jesus Christ. … I think we take a stand for our faith,”** Graham said on Fox News’ “The Kelly File” when host Megyn Kelly asked if Christians should lie in order to save their lives when confronted with death at the hands of Islamic terrorists. ( http://www.christianpost.com/news/franklin-graham-christians-should-never-deny-jesus-christ-to-spare-their-own-lives-131277/ )

**BTW, Franklin Graham is absolutely correct in saying [Islam is wicked and evil](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/?s=islam "Islam") at a different time, but folks, there is more to the Christian life than knowing that. We are in a _life or death_ spiritual struggle. We better realize the true [seriousness of disowning Jesus Christ](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/2011/12/03/fall-away-disown-christ/ "You Can Fall Away FAST")! This is for [eternity](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternity1.htm "eternity")! The devil is trying to take you out!**

[_**Sin unto death**_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sinuntodeath.htm "Sin Unto Death"), like _disowning Jesus,_ is real. Believe the disturbing [_**teaching of Jesus Christ**_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/2012/10/07/teaching-christ/ "Teaching of Christ"), please. **IF you disown Jesus, Jesus WILL disown you.** [The [**Apostle Paul**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/2014/12/20/paul-lords-apostle-false-prophet/ "Was Paul The Lord's Apostle or False Prophet") taught the same as Jesus (2 Tim. 2:12)!] That is reality and the seriousness of disowning Jesus is not “betraying every person who stood for their faith,” namely the martyrs! **The martyrs have nothing to do with it!**

To be blunt, dear reader, **YOU might have to get your own head cut off rather than disown Jesus to save yourself** (1 Tim. 4:16)! **Remember also that your WORDS have the power of LIFE AND DEATH. By your [WORDS](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/words.htm "Power of Words") you will be justified and by your words you will be condemned (Mat. 12:37)! People who downplay disowning Jesus Christ, like Franklin Graham, are setting a lethal snare before their supporters who get under such extreme pressure. Why isn’t there some big name preacher telling Christian people this truth — shouting this fact from the housetops? The answer is, that would be denying eternal security, the so-called [evangelical gospel of our day](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/whichgospel.htm "Which Gospel"). The low quality religious leaders we are suffering under will not make a bold and open stand against such a lie as needed. Remember these Scriptures:**

> In your struggle against sin, **you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood**. (Heb 12:4)

> All men will hate you because of me, but **he who stands firm to the end will be saved.** (Mat 10:22)

**For the [pure in heart](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/keep-yourself-pure.htm "Keep Yourself Pure") to die is a blessing, for he goes to _Paradise!_ Remember that! Don’t fear death, if you are pure in heart.** If you are not pure in heart, you are on the road to hell and must turn from your idols to serve God to have salvation (1 Thess. 1:9b) or raging unquenchable fire is awaiting you. Remember, only the [**gospel of Jesus Christ**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/plan-of-salvation.htm "plan of salvation") can set you free from sin. Be guarded and live in light of eternity. Remember, **Franklin Graham is wrong about the severity of disowning Jesus.**
