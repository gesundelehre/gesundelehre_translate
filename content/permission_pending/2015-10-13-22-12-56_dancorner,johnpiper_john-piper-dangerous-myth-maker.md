# John Piper, DANGEROUS Myth Maker

Posted on January 2, by Eternal Life Blog (Dan Corner)

**Who is John Piper? John Piper (born in Jan 1946) is a Calvinist and was the “pastor” at _Bethlehem Baptist Church_ in Minneapolis, Minnesota for 33 years. In reality John Piper is a grace changer, a license for sin charmer and a dangerous ear-tickling _heretic_.** As a typical eternal security teacher, who knows how to [**candy-coat the security-in-sin gospel**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/2013/05/24/eternal-security-candy-coated-soul-poison/ "Eternal Security Candy Coated Soul Poison") unashamedly, link that to grace in his own mind and present a [**_mythical god_**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/mythical-god.htm "Mythical god") he remains influential and well received. As Peter taught about such teachers who target [_**new converts**_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/newconverts.htm "new converts"), John Piper addresses Mara, a new convert (below)! It’s just like Peter wrote 2,000 years ago about the _John Piper type!_

> **These men are springs without water and mists driven by a storm. Blackest darkness is reserved for them.** For they mouth empty, boastful words and, by appealing to the lustful desires of sinful human nature, **they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in error.** (2 Pet 2:17,18)


## John Piper’s Message To a _New Convert!_

_Just escaping from those who live in error_ (2 Pet. 2:18) refers to new converts. **John Piper tells Mara about his mythical god of eternal security and distorts saving faith.** Piper said:

[![john piper is a heretic](../../files/pictures/hold-on-responsibility-apostasy.jpg)](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/tragedies.htm)

> “Don’t ever start counting your good deeds to see if you have enough of them to make God accept you. That’s not the way He accepts you. That’s what the devil wants you to do, is to relate to God like that.” He explained, **“You are saved, Mara. That is, you’re forgiven for all the bad things you have done and will ever do; you are accepted by God as His child; you are given eternal life by faith in Jesus not by doing good things or being a good girl. That’s so crucial.”**

> [**God in His sovereignty**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/sovereignty-of-god.htm "Sovereignity of God")**, Piper clarified, will maintain believers’ relationship with Him. “God keeps you from unbelief; God holds you in his hand.”** Referring to a Bible passage that proclaims that God knows His followers and no one can snatch them away from Him, Piper urged, “Be confident that God will keep you, God will make your relationship good.” (http://www.christianpost.com/news/john-piper-to-young-believer-be-confident-that-you-belong-to-god-dont-count-on-good-deeds-131301/ )


## Observation From John Piper’s _Snare_ To Mara

*   **How can John Piper say Mara is saved, since Piper is a Calvinist and Calvinists believe _election is secret,_ that is, you can’t tell the** [_**wheat from tares**_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/wheattares.htm "wheat and tares")! In light of that dogma in _Calvinism,_ John Piper can NOT assure her, “You are saved, Mara.” **Perhaps, Mara is just a _false convert!_ John Piper is not consistent with his own doctrine, but none of his supporters seem to notice or care!**
*   John Piper also taught this new convert in so many words: her [**future sins are already forgiven before they are committed**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/futuresins.htm "Future Sins Are Forgiven"); minimizes “being a good girl” and **assures her the sovereign God will maintain her good relationship with him,** that is, [_**once saved always saved**_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/eternal-security.htm "once saved always saved")! **If that was true there would be no [spiritual fatalities](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/spiritual-death.htm "Righteous Can Die Spiritually")! However, the sad truth is, there have been many [_apostates_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/tragedies.htm "Apostates").** When analyzed, **John Piper’s words are _empty_ (see Eph. 5:6), dangerous and designed to entice new converts into thinking [_eternal salvation_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/getsaved.htm "Eternal security or conditional salvation") is theirs without _obedience_, in bold contrast to Scripture:**

[Hebrews 5:9 is the ONLY passage which has the words _eternal salvation_ in it.]

> And, once made perfect, he [Jesus] became the source of **eternal salvation for all who OBEY him** (Heb 5:9)

> who gave himself for us to redeem us from all wickedness and to purify for himself **a people that are his very own, eager to do what is good.** (Titus 2:14)

**John Piper opposes the _obedience_ of Hebrews 5:9 as you just read, but thinks he teaches Biblical _grace_. After Piper is finished with Mara, if she made the mistake of believing what he said, she won’t be _eager to do what is good_ (Titus 2:14) and surely won’t fear the lethal effects of sin! She also won’t be [_holding on_](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/2012/01/27/hold/ "Hold On") to what she has and will, consequently, lose her crown (Rev. 3:11)!** That is just a small part of the problem with John Piper’s poisonous teachings. **John Piper must also oppose other _salvation_ related passages, for his [Reformed theology](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/calvinismrefuted.htm "What is Calvinism") won’t allow them.** Here are a few:

> The one who sows to please his sinful nature, from that nature will reap destruction; **the one who sows to please the Spirit, from the Spirit will** [**reap eternal life**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/2011/11/13/reap-eternal-life/ "Reap Eternal Life"). Let us not become weary in doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if we [**do not give up**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/dontgiveup.htm "Don't give up"). (Gal 6:8,9)

> **By this gospel** you are saved, **IF YOU HOLD FIRMLY** to the word I preached to you. **OTHERWISE, YOU HAVE BELIEVED IN VAIN**. (1 Cor 15:2)

> You will say then, “Branches were broken off so that I could be grafted in.” Granted. But they were broken off because of unbelief, and **you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid. For if God did not spare the natural branches,** [**HE WILL NOT SPARE YOU EITHER**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.eternallifeblog.com/2012/09/19/he-will-not-spare-you-either/ "He will not spare you either"). Consider therefore the kindness and sternness of God: sternness to those who fell, but kindness to you, **provided that you continue in his kindness. OTHERWISE, YOU ALSO WILL BE CUT OFF**. (Rom 11:19-22)

**If you _love a lie_ and a [false hope of salvation](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/assuranc.htm "Salvation Assurance"), don’t worry — people like John Piper aren’t going away.** They have been here since the days of Jude (vs. 3,4) and since truth rejecters desire doctrinal mythology (2 Tim. 4:3,4 cf. Isa. 30:10,11), teachers like John Piper will sadly accommodate them to their own spiritual harm (and his too)! **Unlike John Piper, Paul’s grace message taught a definite serious spiritual danger regarding the illusion that Christians are standing firm, the very goal of John Piper’s message to Mara:**

> So, **if you think you are standing firm, be careful that you don’t fall!** (1 Cor 10:12)

John Piper wants us to believe something totally different, which [**Christians should hate**](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/9reasons.html "Hate Eternal Security"):

> **“God keeps you from unbelief; God holds you in his hand.” … “Be confident that God will keep you, God will make your relationship good.”** (ibid.)

Dear reader, it’s your choice to believe John Piper’s teachings — skewed to conform to eternal security — or the New Testament message in its context. Your choice will determine **how you live and how you live will affect your eternity! [Mara, if by chance you read this, reject John Piper’s advice and believe this [information for new Christians](http://gesundelehre.tk/forwarder.php?url=http://www.evangelicaloutreach.org/newconverts.htm "Information for new converts") instead. It is a misnomer to call John Piper, or any Calvinist, a _theologian._]**
